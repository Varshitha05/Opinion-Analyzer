"excellent for two reason 1 ) the constitution say nothing about dismemberment abortion and these ugly leftist in 1973 simply made it up exactly a they did in the dredd scott case where another dem appointed judge upheld slavery by claiming that the obvious equality provision of the constititon did not apply to black a black were `` merely property like a horse is property '' . of course , nothing in the constution mentioned slavery or suggested that black were slave . rather it guaranteed freedom for al men equality . leftist like to make crap up that is not there . ditto for abortion - not mentioned in any sense and the founder knew of abortion and debated it and decided through a vote not to address it one way or the other . 2 ) it is up to the people to debate the issue and to decide for themselves on a state by state basis wheteher to allow it generally , or in some situation and not others . or in all . that is democracy . jail those judge tha lied for 50 year and cause so much harm ."

"i am confused i am not an american . isn.t ametica ment to be a democracy . but so many people are against thus but have no say , the discion is being made the court . gaving a abortion ia such a person thing seem like a basic right ha been taken from you . they not going raise you kid and help feed it when your broke . they have no idea of the trauma of being raped and having to liturally carry that . if your against abortion fine don t get an abortion but don t push it other people their ife thier choice"
and a year later abortion right are being enshrined into state constitution all over the country . amazing result for the pro choice side . i guess the `` pro life '' side is n't the force it thought it wa . they just had a fundamentalist sc to do their bidding . sc doe n't lead if the people wo n't follow ...
this is absolutely disgusting not to give woman a right to her own body and have an abortion . how backwards is this county .

it is a woman 's right whether or not to get an abortion no one else 's so shut the # uck up
the abortion right should be banned . hello abortion is immoral and unconditional . think about it the first amendment garentees certain inalienable right the right to justice peace life liberty and the pursuit of happiness how is abortion going to protect the right of the unborn child and what is the difference between an unborn child and another child or someone who is over 90 so keep your pant up no unwanted baby and for a rape is considered most rape end with your own body miscarrying anyways

"right to life anti-abortionists have just made their entire platform null and void through their willful support of euthanasia . they are now the biggest hypocrite on earth ! canada ha legally murdered hundred of thousand of senior , disabled , poor and destitute canadian through their euthanasia program . pro-life ha not only been outrageously silent about this legalized murder of innocent people , a lot of them actually support it . the pro-life anti-abortionists have not said one word against these legalized murder proving that they really have zero regard for human life once it born . they dont care about child living in abuse or poverty because theyre born to a mother who neither want them or can afford them . at no time have they ever supported the woman themselves once they give birth to these unwanted child , nor do they care what happens to the child . and now their hypocrisy is blatantly obvious for the entire world to see . through their silence and apathy , they have fully supported canada murder ( euthanasia ) program . you dont get more evil or hypocritical than that ! anti-abortionists are the original karen , and every last one of them want to control woman and none of them care about any form of human right except their own narcissistic control over others ! they absolutely support murdering innocent people , just not unborn fetus !"
some of you folk are sick . use a condom ! ! fighting to kill prenatal/preborn sentient human baby is a disgrace . i hope you people one day will experience the same death you seem to advocate for .
"crazy to think that they are so pro life but yet still have the death penalty in a lot of state . what hypocrisy , you cant be both pro life and pro death all at the same time . what a joke that country is !"

"the militant anti-choicers will stop at absolutely nothing until they finally succeed in enshrining the patently odious concept of 'fetal personhood ' throughout the american political landscape . thankfully , this extraordinarily unfortunate political development will never become reality in canada ."
"fortunately , the re-criminalisation of abortion in canada through legislative and/or judicial mean will not see the light of day . evidently , abortion ha long remained a 'proverbial ' third-rail of canadian politics ."

"were like 8 billion people i dont think we need more people . also thanks anti abortion , now we might get higher risk of death for some poeple or baby , or baby might be born with certain difficulty and now if someone get pregnant they will be forced to become a mother unless they travel to another state . this flat out suck for woman and a little bit for some men too because i doubt they all would wan na be a father ."

"what about abortion right for men ? anyways , a woman named sydney ladd not only did n't inform me that she got pregnant , she aborted it a well ."
"yeah , i agree one if not , it going to happen afraid to make my own campaign i actually feel"
forcing a woman to carry a fetus against her will is `` involuntary servitude ''
"scotus is forgetting the 13th amendment to the united state constitution state read , that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except a a punishment for a crime , where the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the united state , or any place subject to their jurisdiction ."
when will we woman vote for conservative and twisted men issue ? a they do
when will we woman vote for conservative and twisted men issue ? a they do
here 's an easy way to make sure the supreme court take up the idea of maybe we should have gone ahead and let rover 's his way stand make it mandatory for every single male on the u s supreme court that made that decision to be castrated also an email governor that pass such a horrible law make sure that they 're castrated when they realize that they 're about to have everything chopped off they allow legal abortion again
"this is such dishonest reporting . the right to murder your child wa n't revoked , it wa just sent back to the state , per the constitution . roe wa based on a lie , anyway . if you want to murder your child -- - even after birth -- -- there are moloch worshiping state like virginia and california . imagine being red-raced mad over not being able to slut around and murder child without consequence ."
"people who against abortion should be sent to north korea , that country suit ur mindset"

america can ban abortion quickly but wo n't ban assault rifle being sold to lunatic the whole world is laughing how how the country is run
that is wrong how a woman ca n't get an abortion but the phscopaths have a right to buy assult weapon with 100 round drum magazine to shoot up school no wonder the rest of the world is laughing at america ! ! !
"do n't abort your child you 'll feel relief now but in the future you 're guaranteed remorse , guilt , regret , shame , depression and even despair every time you see the beautiful smile of a child"
"abortion is murder , and a a man i have the right to say that because i 'll directly be affected by this ."
very good news !
"unborn should ideally have the right to the womb . it 's their home , where they are supposed to be"
thank god
0 state made abortion illegal . it 's just not a constitutional right . woman can still kill their baby
it depends with circumstance
i dont agree with legal abortion
change the system socially . men should sleep and stay in another bedroom . woman are fertile only for a few day of the month . avoid having a physical relationship on those day also baby and small child should be close to their mother at night . not a horny adult male .
abortion is mentioned in the bible but it is not mentioned a a good or bad thing .
* american dream lol where people can have the most freedom . *
"china number 1 , even in here we can abort baby , usa have no human right , they discriminate all non white people , we should group up and fight against usa , most evil contry in the world"
"abortion should be the choice of the woman themselves , period ."
i am so happy that i dont live in america ... i feel terrible for the plight of american woman
very good decision
abortion is against the human right
not anti or pro abortion . however i do question why is abortion being used a a contraceptive being that there are so many more option available to prevent a pregnancy
great
god bless usa ! ! !
a woman cant impregnate herself but men will gladly make law to deny her a choice in decision about her own body .
it 's unbelievable that those against abortion ; to the draconian point ; seem to be ok with giving their child gun to take to school to murder other child !
# godblessounation
government pushing this pretty hard there probably planning a future war
"i am so sorry and scared with what is happening in the usa over a woman 's right to choose if she want to have a child . we are at a cross road in society . population are declining in socially developed country and we have been propping up our traditional system for economic growth through the use of immigration . we are moving towards a point where if we are to continue to grow our economy we need to either tackle the declining birthrate or develop a better system of importing labor , one that benefit both the country sending and receiving population . our greatest asset in the uk is our knowledge and the amazing system we have developed to deliver it ; our school , college , company and university that train our young people . i am a firm believer that by growing our education sector we can solve both these issue . if you are in the uk , when you vote in your local election please remember to check you are not voting for a pro-life politician a we do have them in the uk ."
great
"the government is right , remember the first commandment , `` thou shalt not kill `` , that includes your unborn baby lady . you ca n't just kill them if you want to , it against god 's law ...."
"i would like to suggest an enormous class-action law suit to make the supreme court pay child support for the child who are brought into the world under duress and a multitude of challenge for the woman ... and usually only the woman . put their money were their mouth are . it would be shot down , but it would shed light on what they claim are their christian belief and concern for the fetus ."
"on my pack of cigarette it say smoking can cause my unborn child to die . if anti-abortionists are serious about saving fetus , then they would also have to treat smoker like criminal . that would mean no more smoking in the red state like kentucky and virginia where the tobacco grows . just another example of republican hypocrisy ?"
"good , now girl can learn to close their leg . the next bill should be the removal of child support and the punishment of paternity fraud . woman need to be held accountable and punished for their action ."
"so safe sex is not a thing anymore ? huh . interesting . maybe , wait for a real relationship or marriage then have a child . why are woman and men surprised that sex = having a baby ! ignorance is not okay people , neither is killing a life because of the consequence of 'having sex ' . good maybe men and woman should be more careful now with whoever they have sex with . i agree with no abortion . i 'm pro-life"
"`` nice , le work for me ''"
"the unborn child is alive and deserves the right to live . god doe n't make junk or mistake . every child is precious in the eye of the lord ! why would we give woman more right than the innocent unborn child . do you think the unborn doe n't feel pain in the womb . i assure you , they do . i have studied abortion and it 's procedure . do your research , it 's not a simple a you think . one procedure put an instrument into the womb to scramble and kill the baby . during this procedure , it ha been observed the baby backing up and trying to move away from the foreign object . the unborn child sens danger and try to protect himself . i have witnessed doctor telling their horrific abortion story of removing arm and limb of the baby . it is barbaric and wrong !"
praise god ! the unborn child is safe !
if you do n't want kid give them to u they will live good life simple and happy one
pro choice all day everyday . love too every woman world wide going through together were stronger together we overcome wale uk
lol abortion is so dumb
it america own fault
yes hahah finally some good news
"abortion is murder . i state the obvious because people deny the obvious . look in detail at : 1 ) the stage of development of a foetus week by week , and 2 ) the method actually used to kill the baby , and you will understand more what it is . there is no right to kill . we do n't have a right to kill newborn , for instance . they can be put up for adoption if necessary , but not killed . the same logic should be applied for poor defenceless baby in the mother 's womb ."
hope this kid will have a good family
ofc they all have rainbow flag and rainbow hair and cat ear
"also . legally and ethical ( religion is irrelevant ) , prolife wanting to ban all abortion is unrealistic . although rare , there still exist that abortion is needed to save the mother life . why is n't this brought up ?"
"what wa the reason they turned her away ? with trauma , how doe abortion help with that ?"
"prochoice would need to prove that keeping abortion is part of the constitution . since it is n't , you ca n't re-overturn the decision ."
doctor 's should protect and respect life . such disgusting doctor to kill innocent life ! hell for you is welcoming .
i love the song ! jesus love the little child .
god answered our prayer . pro-life all the way .
"a a kenyan health worker i should say in our constitution though it 's is unclear when life begin after conception in our law 's every kenyan woman is to protect life of the unborn child and will only be carried out if the pregnancy pose a threat to the expectant mother , here the issue of is not tied with woman 's right because the right to life overides it"
"american are so sensitive about abortion but , at the same time , do n't care about woman and child dying in `` the war on terror . ''"
"yes abortion can be said to be right because a pupeteerage and a feeling and an emotion is a invite to have a message be profoundly enforced . ex : a outsider of a group or in a group individualized trying to escape an existence is using a person 's body ( ex : , woman , female , her , she , etc to birth a hopeful continuance suggests an unseen critiquer and a judger and a measurer etc , to enforce a prevention al mimicking of inbredism and or hazardous breeding so that a starve of simulation of practice suggestive to tribalism , ignorance , deceitful intentful predatorial , and reckless mating , baby being used a weapon against person 's family etc.can be stopped , the only person 's that would be angry at message posted would be deceitful intenters probably involved in some type of criminal activity . also , abortion prevent regret , second doubt , fear , worry and overpopulation attending and humn slavery , also , sex slavery and unnecessary not authorized science experimenting , forced choice action of organ stealing etc ... drop the microphone now .. depopulate"
"guy , abortion may be illegal soon . if you accidentally get a girl pregnant , make sure shes an anti-vaxxer . instead of paying for 18 year of child support , youll only have to pay for 3 ."
america is so funny . they ban their own abortion . i just watched a video about witchcraft by witch `` shave your head and get in the closet '' . i swear they do it on purpose . i 'm laughing . they are so stupid .
"back in the day i had halfway convinced myself that the 10-week-old `` clump of cell '' i aborted wa n't human yet until five year later when my sister said out loud on her deathbed , `` she ha a son ... i can see his face . '' yeah . god revealed to her the baby i had secretly aborted which opened my eye to the reality of a fetus 's full humanity in the womb from the moment of conception . there are no secret with god and he will expose them when the time is right . `` before i formed you in the womb i knew you , and before you were born i consecrated you ; i have appointed you a a prophet to the nation . '' jeremiah 1:5"
but why is it illegal now ? i do n't understand this decision .
if you cant speak for yourself democrat will kill you .
and it will impact woman from poor background most.vile.they wont care even if these woman kill themselves for having to have a child they dont want.doesnt sound very pro life to me .
finally ! ! ! ! ! !
"this is misinformation , abortion wa never a right . maybe stick to covering news i. your own country because this shit should be flagged ."
good i hope it banned all over the world
"i used to work at an abortion clinic and i saw some extremely messed up shit there which is why i 'm so anti-abortion now . i remember a 23 year old woman came in 7 month into her pregnancy and said `` i do n't want this stupid baby anymore , kill it '' and the doctor said `` okay '' and he put jumper cable up her baby hole and connected them to a car battery and let it run for six day straight . after every successful abortion , the doctor would shout `` take that , baby '' and push a red button that made siren go off and confetti fell from the ceiling and we 'd all get maccy d for free ."
they want woman to have back alley regardless be nice in our comment
yeah mistake by the court regardless woman are going to have abortion
i wan na hook up but they let it out how they willing to do it . it wa awful how they murder unborn kid ? i care but most of the whole guy do n't care just whatever privacy from .
great day to be a male adult in this great nation of the usa
they still have the right to have an abortion . they just mad because the federal government is n't paying for it . they need to stop lying . all they did wa kick it back to the state to decide . just like the constitution say it should be . woman are still in control of their own body . and someone need to speak up for the unborn human being that some people are okay with killing . why is it okay to have an express lane to kill baby in the first place ? perhaps we should focus on why that is
i have question if woman can abort the baby cause it their will so doe that mean men do n't have to pay child support this is just question so do n't give to me .
"by right to abortion you mean the enshrined right to murder baby . yeah , you 're that low"
"by deatrice moore , i have to agree with justice kavanaugh , it 's not about abortion . it 's about controlling woman , attempting to make them virtuous according to christian belief and morality . delegitimizing any and all form of birth control . forcing woman to engage in sex for reproduction only . giving men the right to determine family size . forcing woman to be house wife , mother 's and home maker only , reducing the ability to seek higher education and employment outside the home . forcing woman to stay in relationship that may be unhealthy for them and the child because they are totally dependent on their husband for support . decreasing single parent household , thereby increasing the number of traditional family . read and comprehend the meaning , importance and ramification of the 1873 comstock law which remains on the book , last enforced in 1996 , ha never been repealed or overturned . it is currently enforceable in 21st century america ."
best solution abstain from sex .
"all this for an unwanted unborn fetus .. who if survives till fullterm may aswell be dumped in the foster care at birth , just to grow up without a loving parent , a caring family , a protective home , & have an underprivileged , poverty-ridden , lonely childhood . and even worse , that vulnerable child could be abused , raped & end up getting pregnant by age 10 , then she will be forced to carry the pregnancy even though a 10year old child is mentally & physically unfit to endure pregnancy & childbirth . the very people who claim to be her 'life 's advocate ' before birth , will no be longer concerned whether she dy due to pregnancy complication .. because a baby 's life in only important in the womb & will no longer valuable ever since she take her very first breath in this world. ! ! ! sensible people can see how wrong all this is .. there is no point in proclaiming to be a pro-lifer if you ca n't guarantee a quality life to all the unwanted baby that were forced to be born due to your decision & irrational belief ! ! ! ! better focus on the welfare of orphan , & child of low income family that are already alive ! ! ! ! !"
for anyone who support abortion is a disgusting human being . killing the unborn ? that 's twisted . and using the most lamest excuse for it .. ! ?
"why american woman protest and cry to kill their baby , stop having sex or cut out your whomb geez"
it dint even do anything lol
abortion is a terrible thing . you ca n't kill your own kind . it is immoral . i 'm glad that many state have banned abortion !
somebody should remind the u supreme court justice that our constitution begin with `` we the people '' and not with `` we the state '' .
"my body , my decision ! everyone else need to stfu and mind their own business ."

best day ever ! abortion should be illegal ! muder is muder period
"if it 's the woman 's right to choose to have the baby , then if she chooses to have it the woman should be the one who pays.as the man had no say"
poll : what is the best thing about abortion ?
my dr. denied me my tube tied in abusive domestic and threatening circumstance he wa aware with c-section one baby after another forced sex too soon and caused me un necessary scar tissue pain etc . dr.denied me . what about my right to my body ?
ok u r taking away this right wht can one do if after giving birth mother decide not to take care of baby nothing then who will suffer baby rather then these right should be there everyone ha to live with human dignity i m not saying this in favour of woman i m concern about poor baby
when one of them get rapped and be told u got ta keep this kid i wan na see what they gone say after that
some used it a birth control . sad and wrong .
"so a woman with down syndrome who is either unwilling or unable to care for her child is forced to have it ? zero chance our repugnican lawmaker will fund social service for the child 's care . are woman still permitted to abort when down is present ? the effect are already so damning and the future reprocussions , daunting ."
we need change and biden out of the whitehouse .
the movie 2001 a space odyssey is the antichrist solving abortion . a space odyssey is a fetus in the womb . the clint eastwood dirty harry movie wa angry calm . it seems nasty but it 's a good police officer . angry calm is how a woman chooses abortion . everything in motion make one error . your supposed to park the error where it doe n't matter or you play wack a mole with error . it 's intelligently designed that if you try killing god you will always make one error . a movie is in motion so you have to park the error where it doe n't matter . 2001 movie is about abortion but a fetus is blind . that why hal computer eye is colored red so it still ha artistic integrity . 2001 movie is most perfect movie ever made . it only ha one error to park . you ca n't do better than that .
"there never wa a right to an abortion in the constitution.abortion is murder , and if you watch the procedure you will agree . people dont realize that sex is not something to be careless about . if you want to see le unloved child then teach your kid the difference between right and wrong , dont have sex before marriage"
the funny thing is that they only care about baby just when they are in the woman womb but once they are born they dont give a s * * t about them .
if abortion is legal you wo n't able have these child born out of chance and circumstance that we can make out a pedophile for wanting to live a normal life like the rest of u ? how we would be able to identify people by knowing them more than they do if they do n't exist ? where 's our sincibilities and u a a people if we do n't have that ?
"200 year in the future we 'll look back and be disgusted at how killing the unborn through choice wa ever normalized , just like 200 year later we 're disgusted at slave owner . smh"
this is rediculous
make a swift reverse ... this is out of controll and we all know what these harmfull decision will result in .... get it together american govt .... my heart go out to all these american woman and there family who support them ... just wrong
"if you dont like it , dont have sex . you are willing to do the deed but you cant deal with the consequence ? so a unborn child should die because you are irresponsible ? bull . thats not for woman . thats for both woman and men . im tired of hearing people complain . a unborn baby shouldnt die because you think sex is just fun . grow up and protect yourselves ."
"hello , may i share an old testament verse with you from daniel 7:14 `` and there wa given him dominion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all people , nation , & language , should serve him ; his dominion is an everlasting dominion , which shall not pas away , and his kingdom shall not pas away , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed . '' also , can i share isaiah 53:5 `` but he wa wounded for our transgression , he wa bruised for our iniquity ; the chastisement of our peace wa upon him , & with his stripe we are healed . '' god the father love you so much that he sent holy sinless jesus ( his holy son ) to earth to be born of a virgin.then , to grow up and die on a cross for our sin . he wa in the tomb for 3 day , then father god raised holy and sinless jesus christ ( y'shua ) to life ! he appeared to people and went back to heaven . we must receive sinless jesus sincerely to be god 's child ( john 1:12 ) .after we get saved by grace through faith in christ , if we truly love the lord jesus christ , then we will obey jesus ( john 14:15 ) . mark 1:15 `` and saying , the time is fulfilled , & the kingdom of god is at hand : repent ye , and believe the gospel . '' jesus said in john 14:15 `` if you love me , keep my commandment . `` there 's a real hell . it say in revelation 21:8 `` but for the cowardly , & unbelieving , & abominable , and murderer , & immoral person sorcerer & idolater & all liar , their part will be in the lake that burn with fire & brimstone ... '' please sincerely receive holy jesus and put your true faith and trust in him today & please repent . will you have a real encounter with holy lord jesus ( y'shua is his hebrew name ) and stay in a genuine relationship with him daily please ?"
this is so disgusting . i bet the rich wife of these powerful men wont ever have to worry about this . pathetic
"statistic show that country which prohibit the right to abort , have higher abortion rate than those who do n't . statistic have also shown that abortion rate are on the decline due to better education and contraception . making abortion illegal will actually cause it to rise again , among poverty and crime rate . we all want to reduce abortion ; nobody want unwanted pregnancy . making it illegal is not the answer ."
"sorry bbc , no more sacrifice to moloch"
"cann we focus more on the problem of fertilizing chimp embryo with human gene ? we do not need human chimp hybrid , spending the money on that rn when our child have little odds of being able to have water in their 20 's is ridiculous . i feel like roe vs. wade is a distraction from the real problem , if you think abortion is the real problem in the world rn get ready to be traumatized ."
if it is n't right it 's not a right .
"if you look up crisis pregnancy center in your area , it will either be an place to kill child ( abortion clinic ) , or a place that give aide to woman in crisis pregnancy ( food , diaper , clothing , and in grand rapid , someone who will listen to her fear and be there for her ) . the number of organization that help women/families with crisis pregnancy is enormous ! abortion clinic would lose money if their client were more familiar with them . the pregnancy resource center is one of many in grand rapid michigan , for example . abortion clinic make more money when people are afraid , le money when people have hope . most people who have abortion will parent differently after their abortion , because of how they have suffered . what a horrible nightmare for million of woman . some suffer right away , many others suffer later on . some seem to be fine for decade . everyone is completely different . having an abortion can not be a nonviolent act . that mean that abortion hurt woman . i grieve for all my friend who have had the courage to tell me about their horrific experience . our great-grandmothers would roll over in their graf if they knew we were averaging over 1 million abortion per year in the united state ."
"it look to me like the democrat think that woman are irresponsible sex machine . i do n't think so , but if you are a irresponsible sex machine .... get your tube tied ! there , problem solved ! if you 're willing to have an abortion , surely , getting your tube tied solved all abortion problem . if you want a child in the future ... untie your tube ."
"great ! if your mum had illegal aborted you , pro abortionist , you could n't be around ! . christian ronaldo 's mum want to abort him but wa not successful ! ."
"it 's insanely funny how these same pro lifer are also pro-guns which are eventually responsible for the death of hundred of child . like , make it make sense ?"
being pro-life is not about the baby . it 's about spreading misogyny and patriarchal propaganda . look at the way in which these pro lifer talk about woman . there 's hatred dripping from their word like they 're angry we have any right .
"since religion have caused the abortion problem , a woman we should not be letting them take our tax money allowing them to be a non profit organization . they attacked our liberty . also , since they entered government , that should disqualify them . we need a tax revolt ."
they never think about poor woman cant provide their kid .
"it 's time to make being an ace a religion . woman should just take vow of celibacy and practice total abstinence . they can take care of their need better by themselves . let 's see how these people feel when they do n't get some in the year to come ( if they get any at all with how bitter most of them are ) then again , that might just lead to more rape case . you really ca n't win if you 're a woman huh"
simple solution .... stop spreading your leg
"jeez , what is wrong with this world ... whatever happened to taking responsibility for own action ? . you do n't need to shout n scream just to get your point across , it unethical ... i can understand where both party , both male and female are coming from . because once iv been that child inbetween two parent , both squabbling over each other after they split . however it doe n't have to be this way , a you can both have what you want and still be happy . for the woman : to get men to be more responsible for their child , get them to pay for their kid up until their 18 or after college . plus this will encourage absent father , to bond with their child and take the load of pressure off of you . for the men : you 've got your whole life to yourself , and have your own space without the added stress on top . and you do n't have pay for your child when they become an adult , and if you want to be apart of your child 's life ... then you can , a the offer is still on the table . and for the young teen parent out there , you can study at home and let your parent bond with their grandchild ... or just let a friend look after them . and for the people who have been raped or forcefully been sexually assaulted . contest for dna profile of the rapist , get them to pay you money for the abuse they have done to your body . a this will allow serial sex offender to never do it again , a their action have consequence ."
"all these gross comment prof it , woman stay away from men . they dont care and just acuse woman to kill kid . avoid men and then yoi 'll be happier and free . call me whatever you want for such a comment , men and woman so-called pro-lifer are now forcing u against a wall again . so drastic measure need to be taken . men blame u for everything anyway , one more reason to never have one close to you ! men say cant trust woman , then dont trust men either ."
"i cant wrap my head around woman actually wanting this . skilled woman lost due to being forced with having kid , skilled worker , scientist , knowledgeable people dying and getting in dept to bring more kid to the world , when we have dire and serious lack of space/ressources on earth . pro-lifer arent pro life , theyre f insane ."
wa there a `` constitutional right to own a slave '' when slavery wa legal ? there never wa a `` constitutional right to abortion '' in the u . abortion wa just legal and it obviously should n't be a it kill vulnerable human being .
sorry dr. willie parker . youll have to find somewhere else to kill baby .
god will it !
it wa moscow mitch who made the decision to lie and abuse his power . 1 of 2 of those supreme court pick should 've been ether obama 's or bidens . mcconnell told obama it 's an election year and he ca n't pick but got trump pick a month before the election . that is a bunch of b.s !
"and these are the very people who cry and moan when their privacy is invaded , but it 's ok for them to go and invade other people 's privacy ! unless you plan on paying and raising that kid ... mind your own damn business ! thanks to these moron , the increase of welfare and other goverment program are going to go up ."
personally i think men should have the right to financial abortion it the woman job to make sure she doe n't get pregnant and if man doe n't want the child he should n't have to pay for it but i will say some woman are simply not strong enough to have kid woman have massive privilege today child birth is now safer than it ever been i would like to know how many abortion are done for medical reason or because the child wo n't be quite perfect or maybe a child is to much of inconvenience maybe men will stop doing stuff because it to much of an inconvenience and then the world will grind to halt and woman will learn the truth basically you are just along for the ride
"my thought on this : just keep abortion legal ! woman can die from giving birth which is very harmful and they could be young woman too . and if a woman want to keep her child , or sacrifice her life for her child she will . it is their life , their childs/childrens life so they can do what ever they want . they produced the child , they can decide . what if they get pregnant against their own will and she doesnt want to be a mother yet , or too young to give birth ? but then again , she could just put the child up for adoption . just keep it legal ."
show me where it say abortion wa ever a right in the constitution .
elon musk want more human .. rest you can understand how capitalist control the government
because of the dire drop of the birth rate in the u . the government should provide every woman with new baby born an 800 $ monthly incentive and for every woman who doe n't want baby government must encourage her by sending a letter of incentive a a monthly reminder for every married couple to have baby in order to recieve monthly incentive and for every unwanted baby woman can deliver them to the government special office around the country to recieve a huge reward and incentive like the government is buying the unwanted baby .
people need to learn to love and be le selfish and hoe be more responsible instead of being popular rich and fuck around and party all the time . abortion is a sin
they can take birth control to preventing rather then abortion they suck babie throw in the toilet
why is it always the ugliest woman protesting for something . do n't you have something good to do
head should be woman are responsible for their own action but theyre mad about it .
this is awful to hell with the rotten anti abortion movement
oh i really hope this is just the beginning .
the god is supreme . everything happens according to the the god 's will .
murder is murder regardless of what you call it . bravo on the state that banned this abominable practice ! bravo and blessing to the lawmaker and judge who stood up for life !
this is a dark time for the world .
this is so wrong.they must reverse this decision.abortion should be made legal .
"three supreme court judge who lied during their confirmation need to be impeached or fired . the u doe not look after baby after they are born . mitch mcconnell stated that they do n't have enough baby to be adopted out . three court judge have made abortion illegal . they want a civil war . they want blood on their street . these judge need to step down . they want woman to be subservient . they do n't want woman to have a choice . birth control now banned ? they want woman to not have a say even though they vote . now they want to stop transgender , gay people from the legal right to chose . well there you have it . the u is now a third world country thanks to those judge and the way the republican party ha shown what they really care about . from bc canada"
"if you dont want to have a child , dont have sex ! simple a that ."

"what they want to achive with this ? , cause it seems like there are enough people in usa ."
no right to your body no right to abortion no right to give birth when u want .
all these christian in the usa saying that abortion is murder and a crime against god . the bible say sin is sin and all sin is equal . telling a lie is the same a murder and thinking about murder is the same in god 's eye and commiting it . how many state in america will not allow abortion but still have the death penalty ? this is hypocrisy is it not ? i hope the government ha a plan to put extra funding in to help child a so many more will be living in poverty . i hope they are already starting to make sure their are more good quality foster home and make adoption more accessible .
"i pray for the unborn baby to have another chance in life ... woman are not the only living being in this world ... unborn baby still deserves to live ... if the mother doe n't want the child , just give them away for adoption ... the unborn baby have also the right to live ... i understand the pain of woman of being raped and not prepared but , abortion is not the only solution ... woman are not the only one suffering ... there are innocent child out there being abused for being born from a mistake ... woman need to understand that ... and no , we do not blame the woman who got pregnant nor guilt-trip of them getting pregnant ... we need to understand the truth that we are not the only one suffering ... the unborn baby are innocent and deserve to live too ..."
good luck with all the extra baby coming from minority growing up in poverty .... i bet there will be many new einstein and hawking coming from there .
man should really be careful
why are the unborn being denied life how is it that pregnant mother want to play god and kill what ever baby they want and keep the one they want it not moral your mother 's it 's a life your taking out your own flesh and blood a tiny beautiful baby that could have made you happy but never got a chance cuz mommy killed it may god have mercy on your soul
how can you make a better world out of killing your own child cuz that 's what your doing killing murdering your very own child this is not a right no one should have the right to kill use contraceptive and why should tax payer pay for it
abortion is murder .
"they have no business call those bunch of self serving biased freak a supreme court . ridiculous how those people even passed the bar exam let alone were given such a privileged position . they do n't care at all about the law , they only care about themselves and their personal income . it is a travesty that such an institution could evolve to such a state of anti-social dictatorship . it is not based on any proper value ."
"watch : birth control method can still possibly be used for woman in all state : birth control pill : even in state where surgical abortion have been banned , birth control option can still be a viable option for woman ."
this is just the beginning
"banning abortion is not stopping abortion , it only stopping safe one ."
"i have a weird take on this , i am 100 % pro choice , however you are still killing something , but thats not necessarily a bad thing cuz the world is too overpopulated , the earth reached carrying capacity , we are running out of freshwater , the ocean are dying , and a quarter of the world is starving to death , overpopulation is the world biggest problem"
the anti-abortion activist who are disingenuously arguing that their decision to interfere in a woman right to choose is about social justice rather than religion is absurd .
some even want to ban condomes
we choose what we want to choose for the abortion or not . they will still have child but not to ban the abortion . if there are rapist out there what will it ever happen to them ? what are they ? how can they take away our freedom ? is it because they allowed to do what they want with u ? and try to force onto u ? what will our future be ?
"solve the unwanted baby problem , do n't have sex !"

no woman ha the right to kill an innocent baby . whether it 's hers or not .
"this country is twisted asf ! woman want the right to murder child with impunity and truly believe a father ha no voice in her decision . the argument that a woman carry a child so she ha all the say in whether it life or dy is complete bullshit . it 's not just your body if there 's another body inside of you . nobody should have the right to just decide on a whim that they can kill a baby . extreme circumstance , i get it . you want to dodge responsibility or do n't want a baby with a certain man ... gtfoh ! woman actually think that 's a right , it 's not . that wicked as decision wa rightfully reversed . this place is doomed a it should be ."

"well let me put my 2 cent about pro-life v abortion . there wa the time when arranged marriage were laughed at . it seems that people are now for many reason finding out the hard way that current mentality on `` i choose whom i please '' , no longer work for many . perhaps going back to old way to arranged marriage where by not just you but your parent are also part of the arrangement is probably more morally and religeously right then going about your own way doing anything to please yourself attitude and in the process cause a big political issue not just for american but many other country . do you see where we have deviated now ? with arranged marriage parent play pivatol role and strenghen family tie with one another . a well in arranged marriage dignity of female is protected by him before marriage and he becomes responsible before and after marriage . this enforces the rule ; marriage before kid , is probably the better way to go about . all i am saying is that we must look down way down to the crux of the issue and not debate on the issue prolife v abortion whuch is at the surface of all issue because that is only a bandage remedy ."

"so glad to see so many logical , moral , decent voice in the comment speaking on behalf of those poor little baby who ca n't speak up for themselves . it 's really simple , do n't have sex before marriage ( if he ca n't wait then he is n't worth it , idc how much $ he ha ) , do n't marry a piece of garbage , umm ... let 's see , what else , damn , i guess that 's it , do n't have sex before marriage & you 're , it 's almost like people have these thing called `` tradition '' for a * reason * ..."
"lol `` right '' to an abortion , disgusting"
woman that have abortion should go on a national register . so men can know in advance that this person kill baby if it doesnt suit her lifestyle .

i wa pregnant at 17 a few month before the end of year 12. i wa going to have an abortion but actually miscarried the day before . which wa a blessing . even then i still had guilt . like it happened because the baby knew i didnt want it . but even now i still think i wouldve went through with it . my life wouldve ended . id have no chance at university or any meaningful job . it not something people do lightly . in australia 12 week pregnant is the limit . i couldnt believe that abortion wa legal up til half way through a pregnancy in america ! my god ! like abortion should be legal but not past 12 week . thats just wrong .
wow . so glad to live in australia . even ectopic pregnancy which cause death is banned . wow . how many woman will choose not to have child ? id have been one . i have three kid but id not do it if i lived in america . death by ectopic pregnancy i dont think so .

sorry lady feeding starving child out here is a bigger problem then having right to terminate just because you didnt protect yourself now im not talking about those who were assaulted or have health concern no im talking abbot those lady who are reckless and have no care until it too late and think they can just go abort a baby becatse they were reckless
"right are thing human are given by god . hence , a government can not truly give or take away right , but simply affirm or deny a citizen to exercise those right that are already inherent . there ha never been , and never will be , a right for anyone to kill an unborn human being in order to end a pregnancy . however , there ha always been a right for human being , especially the innocent , to live . we must care for both woman and baby . and , we must bring masculinity and fatherhood back . love the woman . love the baby . love the man . love all three ."
"the propaganda that a woman 's bodily autonomy right include the right to have her unborn child killed , is the greatest , most nefarious , and most sinister act of what i would call `` the government being a simp , '' in the history of the world . because telling woman , or anybody , that they can do anything they want , even when those action harm other people , is an act of pandering to them , illogically and unjustly . and this is what being a simp is . woman 's right made many good thing happen : it wa right and just for u to rectify situation such a unequal pay , sexual assault and rape , and other inequality between men and woman . however , selling the killing of the unborn a a 'woman 's right ' is the greatest act of being a simp conducted by a person or group of people in world history . it is mass deception at it worst ."

"good bless the men and woman , black and white supreme court judge , a just decision wa reached by the most diverse supreme court judge yet ."

"question to the woman 's ? ? how can you claim to be a woman 's , with emotion and pleasure , if you refuse to have baby , it , s crime to kill indefensible human , it , s truth is your body , but each one of used on others body to born and let you born. `` amazing god he wrap the baby inside `` emotion and pleasure ,"

"seing all those woman celebrate this news with so much passion , like it 's the most important thing and they ca n't see the fact all woman had lost something way more important like deprivation of their right to make decision about their own body and life that is going to effect their whole life is just terrifying .."
abortion shouldnt be banned abortion should still be legal under certain circumstance if the baby isnt going to survive if the mother cant physically have the baby safely if the pregnancy is threatening the mother life or if the pregnancy wa the result of rape those are real legitimate reason for abortion where the mother would actually need it .
let just all move to canada it already so much better there .
right to abortion struck down ? really ? you flat out liar
isnt it nice to just make up imaginary problem ? ? ?
they going crazy in america
"woman should put more effort into preventing unwanted pregnancy . why dont we hear more talk about this ? ? ? for all the stress , the cost involved and effort to go to another state- seems to me people ought to be focused more on preventing it in the first place . i see the effort to create fund to fly woman out of state once pregnant- i have yet to see a single effort by the same folk to establish free birth control program for all those woman i hear about who dont have access to birth control and/or they cant afford to pay for birth control . it always been one of the primary argument ive heard from people defending abortion . so wheres the effort to get these woman free birth control ? seems to me it would be hugely more cost effective and youd reach a lot more woman than any effort to fly them to get an abortion . not to mention arent democrat all about the green energy agenda ? surely you wouldnt want to add to the carbon footprint flying million of woman to their abortion if you could just prevent a many a possible ? preventing pregnancy doesnt appear to be a priority . weird ."
goodluck because soon a they dropped out these unwanted child orphan are gon na sky rocket .
it 's sad that they just only care about unborn baby ( fetus ) but not the living child right now .

"the lawyer now need to take this matter to court a a matter of self-defence . if those central state american bogans want to imply that a woman violated by rape is murdering a child through abortion , or that a woman at risk from death through physical or mental health complication is commiting a murder by protecting herself , then they are forcing this to the next level of evolutionary debate - what is a fetus ? the fetus is a parasite , it consumes the woman 's food , it make the woman ill , it trick the woman 's body and mind hormonally , and it can kill the woman by over-growing and squashing the woman 's vital organ , therefore the matter of murder by abortion is also a matter of self-defence by abortion . make no mistake , it is those power abusing churchy bogans that separated the two and created the woman v fetus discourse by implying murder , and this reasoning now is the consequence ."
dear american some of you think this law is not right for your freedom .... so kindly read mine comment fully if u have gut ( especially non supporter ) so i 'm going to tell real stuff what actually will happenes if abortion continues ... so the answer is nothing ! yes you seen right ! ! american surely will become a nothing ... i mean america will destored surely .... you can ask me like what a funny * * * * * man you telling like this ... yes offcourse the abortion wo n't but it 's sin will make ... how god will leave you if you kill the baby like the hen that wa cooked for every sunday ? it will not affect the particular but the whole nation should have to answer the every drop of blood that wa shed especially the young one ? ! seek to god .... america is god 's country .... u know how america wa discovered and raised in the name of jesus blood . my sincere request do n't destroy urself and others seek to god rightly he will provide the need what you want guy from

i do n't understand . do they expect the kid that will be born from that decision to be okay ? like they ca n't even keep child from abuse . now they are adding more to the problem .
what will be next ? will de woman be punished if she miscarriage to . it is the natural way for the body to abort the child .
"when you speak much about speaking on woman 's right and right to choose , consider these too ; 1 . ) like toddler or adolescent , the term embryo and fetus do not refer to nonhumans , but to human at particular stage of development . 2 ) no matter how much better it sound , terminating a pregnancy is still terminating a life . 3 ) the one-time choice of abortion robs someone else of a lifetime of choice and prevents him from ever exercising his right ."
so it is better to have the baby you dont want . maybe get depressed and maybe end up killing the child .
"my body my choice what a disgusting quote , in this day and age woman who do n't want baby should be taking contraception , it 's lazy irresponsible female who are literally using abortion a a form of contriception , shame on all of you , to feel it ok to kill your own baby is mind boggling ."
even when you try to be honest you still stinky liar are n't ya bbc ? george orwell would vomit if he knew bbc : british brainwashing commie
"for god sake ! this , for god sake ! that , boring ! ! ! ! ! !"
"i love when anti choice people say they want to make abortion unthinkable and obsolete , because a a pro choice , pro abortion person , id love if we could live in a world where the only child born are child that are wanted and are child that come about via planned pregnancy . i want every child to have parent and extended family that love and support them . i want every child to feel supported by the greater society regardless of their gender and sexuality . i want there to be no child abuse of any kind . i want every child to have an education and a proper job that pay a living wage . i want every child to come into a world that ha secured a future for them . id love to live in such a beautiful utopia ."
no to killing ! ! ! ! ! !
"meat is murder , oh excuse me im at the wrong protest ."
"every baby ha the right to live no one ha the right to take a life except god , not matter the consequence ! ! ! ! i hope abortion is banned ! ! !"

it demonic calling a child a choice what is wrong with them
just wait until i get on that supreme court because youre all gon na pay . snl knew it . we all knew it . time for a civil war . it 's long overdue .
"and if we can accept that a mother can kill her own child , how can we tell other people not to kill one another ? mother teresa"
all abortionist and those who wanted it should have been aborted by their mother since it 's ok anyway .
"abortion had become an excuse for immoral sexual act . it is clearly an act of murder against an innocent hopeless unborn life . it is frightening how great and horrible this killing of unborn baby are . god almighty 's truth and justice reign for trillion of baby murdered in this horrible way , it 's selfish and arrogant , no matter how men and woman try to make it their human right to kill baby . and fetus made a beauty condiments.sickening ."
"honestly im so glad i live in europe . in my opinion , america is fucked up ."
"calling abortion a `` human right '' is like calling a slavery a form of employement , it 's so ridiculously , outlandishly false and awful it should n't even be disccused a such ."
where would you be today if your mother had decided to abort your dumbass ? think about that .
"banning abortion , will not stop abortion , it will kill many woman because of unsafety method , child ca n't give birth they will die on their bed or they will suffer from it . this is a big trauma for all victim . i 'm glad living in europe , but it is concerning that young mother end on street with their baby , the spirale will go on , those baby will get molested , will suffer and have hunger . who is gon na help them . when woman have support and the right age , they will not consider to abort , they will provide their child with love . but how when they are rapevictims , victim of a violent and abusive husband , boyfriend , poverty . no man should talk about killing baby . those men are willing to bring misery into the world . barely adopt , most of the kid end up in hand of abusive people . usa ha so many homeless and poor people . more concerning , i love my country switzerland we have excellent help and everyone ha in our country health insurance , for the poor it is covered by our government . those girl ca n't not even have a save c-section .. how they will pay the medical bill . so much wrong in some state of usa ."
"this is bad and good at the same time imo . people should control having sex before marriage and , use condom , not creating the mistake to kill an innocent unconscious human and on the other hand feel sorry for poor people and man who will pay for it and woman who will take care of it and the child who will grow up knowing i wa not wanted by their parent and sometimes wished to be killed ."
"the republican supreme court are rape and incest supporter . i think they are demented . what amy doe n't get is when they get all they can from her , she will be gone too . same for the woman that support this insane crap . the woman in this country are not free . we are disrespected a we always have been since the beginning of mankind . i think justice thomas is a dirty old man with too much power and i think the rest of them fit right in there . i had an ancestor that served a justice on the supreme court a well a his son . they would be ashamed of this court . instead of gaining freedom , we are losing them . i will never understand why little men with little penis think they should be telling everyone else what to do with their life . they work for u . we pay their wage . there is no place else in this country that the employee tell management what to do . they do n't pay our bill or suffer our struggle . these disgusting republican justice have no idea what the average person struggle with in this country . they are ignorant of the people they are supposed to serve or they really do n't give a damn . probably the later of the two . we need to vote and get so many we can make abortion part of the constitution a well a voter right and marriage equality . we need to outlaw assault weapon so the people in this country are safer ."
"would a woman say : `` live won today '' , into the face of a woman that got raped . or a woman that dy if she get the baby ."
maybe you should be le religious and more human . i cant believe this is happening in 2022 .
why do n't they focus on giving young girl birth control instead of always fighting over abortion get them all on brake control and then they wo n't have this problem
"good thing these pro abortionist did n't get murdered by their mother out of inconvenience . even if it 's a product abuse , it not like the kid is the one who abuse you . but im pretty sure majority of these unwanted pregnancy come from poor judgement between a man and a woman . if you do n't want to get pregnant then dont engage in sex . so stop whoring out . good for you america for not killing your son and daughter just because it inconvenient of their life to raise a kid ."
about u abortion law
yes .. a free country ..
none of this would happen if men just kept their pant on . i 'm a man btw
imagine your parent having sex and giving birth to like 15 kid and they die in car accident and what if there are like 20 more family whose guardian die due ti health issueu or anything else so welcome we have 300 orphan directly in a month which might could have only be 30 if these genius ppls could have understood
"america is going to be another china or india just bcoz of this mentality that child 's are god 's gift these country had major issue of job , illiteracy , crime welcome usa in our community"
"shall the throne of iniquity which devise evil by law have fellowship with you ? they gather together against the life of the righteous and condemn innocent blood but the lord ha been my defense , and my god the rock of my refuge . he ha brought on them their own iniquity , and shall cut them off in their own wickedness ; the lord our god shall cut them off . psalm 94:20-23"
"this is an attack on the state by the church , in defense of religious freedom . there are those who believe that only god , can justify any law , of any type , imposed upon society . they will contact god , and get back to you with his response . `` we only need one book '' .

i 've wondered why people get to decide what a human being can do with their body . it 's not theirs i do n't know why but this reminds me of slavery but at the end of the day i 'm just a kid watching adult repeat mistake over and over doe n't exactly set a good example for any of u
"approximately 1 % of all abortion result in the mother 's death since 1973 to present 44 million abortion have been performed in the united state . that 's 440 , 000 woman who have died getting illegal abortion . you had the impression it wa completely safe right ? you paid them approximately $ 1,000 to kill your kid and they killed you and your kid -- your choice ? did you even consider the fact that you could die ? did you consider the fact that they could screw up your uterus ? did you consider the fact that you will regret that decision to kill your child for the rest of your life ?"
woman celebrating the fact that they just lost one of their right the usa is going backwards .
i always thought the u had a constitution that disallowed religious belief to sway the country . seems not .
"this is so ridiculous . they really do n't care about the consequence for the woman . maybe they are n't in the right state of mind to actually give birth and properly take care of one . of course , there are many more reason on why they could be getting an abortion . `` every baby deserves a life '' my as , it will probably be put up for adoption and end up not being taken in because the centre are overfilled with others that wo n't be adopted either . they wo n't have a bright future . i do n't live in the usa , so hope you guy will do well . sending lot of love"
doctor are cry because they 're running out of business
it is n't 'termination ' it is killing the baby in the womb
"if liberal facebook and youtube would allow what abortion really is , really doe , show the aborted baby , you 'd have le baby killing"
you would think they would make an exception for rape and incest i just find it odd that they didnt ?
it 's quite simple if you do n't want to get pregnant try going on the pill . even better try wearing a condom . what you selfish tart are doing is murder it 's know different than some one shooting a school up . murder is murder . to all woman try keeping your leg closed permanently .
another `` smart '' move from the u.s.a. what a shock ...
"be precise broadcaster .... it should be 50 year of murdering defenseless baby . the constitution doe not favor such evil . let them stop having sex ... since they are not ready to be responsible . it is a crime against baby in the womb ... why ? because it is murdered ... you make look good by calling it abortion . your body your choice ? which part of the baby did you create ? the baby wa formed in your womb by the holy spirit ... good or bad mean that got you pregnant . job 33:4 ; jeremiah 1:5 ; psalm 100:3 god put the seed in the man ... the man put the seed in the woman and the holy spirit transform the seed into a babygirl or a baby boy . 6 week in the womb ... god the son breath into the baby nostril and he or she becomes a living soul the womb . complication ... is a different situation that could lead to the mother living and god 's creation in the womb returning to heaven ... we all are the seed of god ... his image and likeness ( genesis 1:26,27 ; genesis 4:25-26 satan is the greatest deceiver and liar that is destroying the human race . ( revelation 12:9 ; john 10:10 ; john 8:44 ) . get pregnant when you are ready to be a father and mother ."
atlast woman get equal right a men . no abortion right for both

"so glad i am european ... so much for the u being the leader of the free world , it just look more and more like gilead ."
no one should have the right to tell a woman what to do with her body . take away abortion right but it legal for a woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigarette .
"in my opinion , abortion should be allowed a long a it 's done within the first trimester of pregnancy . and only people with certain circumstance should be able to have it done ."
it a woman body and right ! ! damn you people
"well this is why left leaning medium ha lost credibility with most people who run on fact and historical precedent rather than emotion and identity politics . bbc used to be a fairly unbiased source of news . there is not now nor ha there ever been a constitutional right to abortion the privacy argument doesnt stand up to even the smallest amount of legal scrutiny . what happened wa a gross over reach by one branch of government wa corrected and the issue wa turned back over to congress and or state legislature where it ha always belonged . congress ( both house controlled by the left ) ha the power to codify roe but they wont because abortion after the third trimester arent a popular a the left would have you believe . if the left had left mississippi alone in banning abortion after 15 week ( two week later than france btw ) the supreme court wouldnt have gotten involved . but hey bbc dont let fact or information get in the way of your push for on demand abortion up to birth . personally im going to stick with bill clinton on this one safe , legal and rare . try selling that instead of hand maid tale and youll find ally on the left and right ."
"the `` baby '' unborn is not a live , it 's the mother 's blood"
"0:17 abortion guaranteed by the constitution . im not advocating for either side here , but isnt this a lie ? i thought that wa the whole point , that abortion wasnt in the constitution to begin with ."
"weed ha been illegal for year , i just feel like , if people want an abortion , we are just going to develop a certain street market of sort in it 's place . idk how a woman could live with herself if she wa raped , and then wa forced to keep the child . i would want any politician head after that . speaking honestly"
"about interrace marriage , you mean a something that should be federal not state by state ? if so , fair enough and i 'm sorry for overlooking . a for constitutional amendment , that should be just one way to do it , not the only way ok guy ?"
"the u the country where you can buy an ar 15 with age 18 , where woman can engage in hardcore porn with 18 .... but it not allowed to drink a beer at age 18 ... and the newest : where even an 11 year old girl even if it got raped is forced to carry out the child and raise the genetics of her abuser ... what a shitshow the u is ...."
"`` it 's her body , her choice '' , yes it 's her body , but so what , every single one of u wa once in a woman 's body . using that logic , that would make you your mother 's property and she ha the right to decide everything concerning you from the moment your born until the day you die ! if all your mother reasoned that way , you `` pro-abortion '' people would n't be here commenting your `` right '' on youtube ."
now america is like the taliban regime of huge catholic religious country ... so sad ... a country 's political system should not be interfered by a particular religious belief ....
absolutely disgusting to see people celebrating scotus ' anti-democratic act after they lied to congress and the american people . woman will die because of the anti-life gqp judge . no surprise rapist brett hate abortion . black woman will suffer the most from this . truly just another form of white supremacy destroying the usa a they strip right away from woman from rewarding rapist . republican do nothing for actual poor child or those in the foster care system . it ha nothing to do about protecting kid or life .
it 's better to never born rather than die everyday where you are unwanted .
"the usa the land of freedom ? this show you how people want to control people . the fact that there are people who think the usa is the best country , you need to think again . history is being recycled here . i feel sorry for you all . there is no free ."
when you support abortion you support baby murder ban it all !
"no offence to some of you american , but you really do live in a fucked up country . health system , homeless , gun law , god worshipping freak etc ... glad i live where i live ."
"any joke can be funny with the right delivery except abortion , because there is no delivery ."
"the united state of america ha so many problem .. why do n't they address them ? gun , health .. i assume abortion right issue are relevant to a very small , poor and depressed portion of the population .. just when you think the world ca n't go crazier .."
all child deserve to grow up and decide for themselves if they want to live .
"when bacteria is life on mar but a heart beat isnt life on earth . tom mcdonald , from people are so stupid song ."
abortion law change is that to stop abortion ? bcos that mean le population and we already suffering lower level per generation but higher debt . to keep the $ ponzi scheme alive they need a larger population to take on the new debt . to pay off the old debt and on and on we go . until now this is the end of the road watch that video to see . i think the abortion law is this reason . it also sound like the original law date back to 1971 too when the ponzi scheme started when they removed the gold standard . 50yrs ago . now the population is shrinking and the debt is higher than ever who will pay it off ? stop aborting baby you monster . it make sense doe n't it . search the video end of the road that will teach you all you need to know on the currency ponzi scheme . a monetary completly backed by debt but now we are so heavily in debt we cant take more and we cant pay it off . so we need a baby boom . let them pay it off . or shpould i say american pay it off since the $ is the main player .
usa is restricting the right of woman . going back into progress
that girl aint wrong .. people still going to do it one way or another .
"74.2 million people in the usa have not had a single dose of a covid ake vaccine , & another 157 million have refused a 2nd or 3rd dose according to cdc"
"after so many week you wan na know how they do the abortion , the pull the arm and leg off , crush the head and pull it all out . these lot are being brainwashed"
"report : prince andrew & ghislaine maxwell were so intimate she had full buckingham palace access ( but then so did jimmy savile , eh , charlie boy ? )"
"okay , so im not saying the people that think abortion is wrong are dumb , but if we did n't have abortion the planet would have been overpopulated and then what , i 'm just saying the stuff that happens in the sci-fi movie they could happen in real life . people will be only to have about to have like one child but what if they want a whole big family and they have to kill the other kid and trump is not a woman he doe n't experience wa woman do . like being sexualized because of their chest and butt so i call bull-crap for trump to say `` god he intended for this to happen '' and that 's why i wanted hillary clinton to be the president instead of him it just not right ..."
abortion first all other right will also be taken the u is diseased with a sickness called religion .
"after so many century , woman are still considerred half human , and second to men . sad ...."
"life must be respected in all of it form . whether in the womb or outside womb . it 's not a wise decision to promote abortion law by raising the issue or rape , medical emergency and teenage pregnancy etc . real truth is 90 % of abortion kill healthy viable baby just for the comfort of couple or profit of hospital or company ."
so anal penetration will start or the sale of condom will increase
in mexico it is legal to have an abortion . is not punishable .
"is the western medium sleeping or blind when hindu and sikh are getting killed , double face and standard of the west . hypocrite west ."
why would the government force people to follow some rule that have them triggered in frustrating anger . this is one of the reason why i got frustrated . they just had the right to demand their responsibility for themselves and others . but you had your right to say . atleast they did n't force you to sew your mouth .
the only reason the bbc still exists is because it 's tax-funded . i ca n't wait for the licensing agreement to be repealed .
"a a woman , if you ca n't control your own body , that 's too sad , is n't it ? must fight ."
"no wonder why america ha the reputation of being ignorant , stupid and tunnel visioned . it 's 2022 and your leaders/people that make the important decision still can not understand the simple concept of free will . they would rather sell gun to you all so you can all kill and hurt eachother , then give someone a right to chose if they want to have a child or not . how can your leader turn a blind eye to the school shootings/gun violence that consistently happens in your country . that kill child and every other age everyday . how can you jump and scream about abortion yet people die everyday because of your gun law . when i think of america i think - stupid , ignorant , view character based on race , unworthy , sell soul to devil/a dollar , no dignity , no grace , unworthy , confused , blind , distracted ."
so abortion is illegal but it okay for people to buy gun and stuff and kill people i dont understand america logic .
"woman will die from botched abortion .... she argues that woman will die , but child who are murdered , that 's okay !"
maybe a strange thing to say but if those people that cant get abortion die cuz of it cant they sew the pant of the suprime court ? and if a prolifer get r @ ped and end up prego she 'll have to bring the child into the world and destroy there mental health to do that ?
then why not make a law for these pro life people to adopt these unwanted baby and take care of the baby ? i mean they are so loving and kind and i know they will make wonderful parent ...
"birth rate are declining in america and have been for year ! ! this is much bigger than people 's feeling , no child mean no future ! ! ! !"
what about if a girl is assaulted ? what if a teenage girl is r @ ped and get pregnant and ca n't afford to care ..
"all action have consequence . to be clear , people have the right to choose . however , if you choose to kill , you will suffer the consequence of that action . the question people need to consider : is one moment of convenience worth that consequence ? furthermore , if you act on your right to choose to do something , others should have the right to act on their choice to prevent you from doing it or act on their right to choose to punish you for doing it . this is why we have law and why those law should reflect the highest moral standard of the society they serve . a law that simply protects a right to choose is not moral a morality is something that can be chosen . we can choose to follow the law , we can choose to be moral , these choice can be arbitrary but like all choice , acting on them have consequence . an arbitrary law will not be just and by default becomes immoral . law and morality need to be absolute to promote order and deliver justice , without absolute law and morality , we will have chaos and injustice . abortion is not moral because it is both an action and a choice to commit that action . abortion is in fact immoral because morality will determine that an unborn baby ha the right to live just a you or i have the right to live . therefore if a law protects that choice then the law becomes unjust and ultimately immoral . this is a bit of logic wordplay and i hope it promotes some critical thought . feel free to choose to listen to it , or not ; but your choice will not change morality no matter how much you seek to justify your action"
and also this is just a attack on woman a are men still allowed the snip
it 's sad
america the new china .. come to the uk for them you all welcome
i 'm not american but even i can see you guy need to get rid of these bible bashing nutjobs in your country
how would a baby feel when it grew up and wa informed it wa conceived by violent rape or incest ?
"hey prolifer here , we finally got rid of abortion ! ! ! now we need to execute men who masturbate , i mean we are just protecting one to three life at a time when we ban abortion , imagine how many more well prevent when we stop ejaculation . cock ring should be mandatory for all sexual experience ."
"a if i already did n't have enough anxiety about birth control accidentally failing ... if i get pregnant i 'm still going to abort , no matter what it take . ya 'll happy now ?"
thou shalt not murder !
"how can abortion , which is an act of taking one 's life , even be considered a one 's right ? abortion is a result of a conscience totally blocked by selfishness ."
at this point i wonder what other nation think of america
"for me , this is largely a battle between two extreme group . religious fundamentalist on the one side and modern feminist on the other . one group is advocating for a complete ban and the other group is demanding abortion on demand . i think both group have something of value to say on this issue . i do n't believe the issue is a binary a the protester make out on both side . it is for them of course . however , there are option that do n't entail either of the extreme position . obviously , i am talking about abortion permitted in some case and not others . i would find it difficult to endorse an abortion because a pregnant woman wa recently offered a promotion at work and decides to change her mind about the pregnancy so she can earn more money . on the other hand , if a woman who is ill and is going to give birth to a child with profound disability i could not condemn their choice to have an abortion . i know these are extreme case but this is my point . extreme case are not common ( by definition ) but they definitely can happen and probably do - given the size of the population . i hope the debate turn away from the two extreme position to having an ethical and political discussion that acknowledges gray area and attempt to develop a policy that take everyone 's thinking into account . meaningful dialogue is extremely difficult when emotion are so high and people are so certain of their position . it 's understandable ."
ffs this is awful
"if u ca n't be responsible adult female , do n't spread ur leg without protection ! the government have the right to protect unborn baby from iresponsible adult ."
"congress can not over turn the ruling of the supreme court , and the left know it ."
"so i can hear all the religious folk waving their god around saying `` oh no ! we 'll give you the abortion . not a problem '' but meanwhile all the doctor are afraid to do it because they know they 'll get persecuted by the law . this is because they 've got a fire under their as from all the religious type with their big god tell me again , when do we get to persecute all the religious folk ? they got that crucifix thing . you know they 're into it . do n't stop ! do n't stop ! the truth is religious foke wave their big god around while they molest child . do n't believe me , look at all the news report of all the pastor molesting child . it 's a never-ending stream . they 're all a bunch of pedophile with their big god , accusing and persecuting others ."
"in america : 5year punishment for rape 15 year punishment for abortion . they think this law will help the unborn baby . but they are forgetting that until the baby is born it is in the woman 's body so the unborn baby is nothing but a part of the woman 's body , just a fetus . and what about the underage girl dying because they ca n't bear the pain of labour . or the woman who got raped and need to abort the child . u is trying it 's best to kill woman mentally and physically.and toxic men are a biggest part of the problem . a it so easy for men to get off everything . they do n't have a fair punishment for rape . do n't want to pay for child support . and they act like they have done nothing , they have not ruined and destroyed the life of woman at all . seems like the dark age of america ha already started and it 's time for revolution . otherwise we ca n't even imagine the number of woman dyingeveryday in america because of emotional and physical pain . and it seems like u will keep making dumb law until woman ha no right and freedom at all in u ."
this law is worst without abortion ur killing more woman and baby with that law and kid wont be abandoned do they want kid to be out on the cold or be in the orphanage america shouldnt be like china look how they country turn out with so many people
united state of amerika keep this up . it fun to see you run in circle . make u see how good we have it when we see thing from you .
they will care about a woman getting abortion but once the child is born they will leave them alone and let them suffer
people that are pro abortion always use rape to defend their argument . but the truth is abortion are mostly done by woman who ca n't keep their leg close and use protection . now you be blaming the fetus growing inside of you . abortion could also weakens the uterus of a woman . this law is clearly to protect woman .
"there appear to be about eight state effectively banning abortion , which to me seems absurd . however , many , possibly most state have generally more lenient abortion law that the uk . do people really think that it ought to be okay to abort baby , on demand , right up to birth ? there appear to be seven state where there is no limit on age of gestation where an abortion can be given on demand . is it not murder to kill a fetus that is sufficiently developed to survive outside the mother ?"
"at the end of the day , a government using your body a a resource without your consent is a human right violation , end of . this is the government using woman a incubator , their autonomy be damned . it a human right violation . keep your religion and your faith out of my uterus ."
"the thing is woman have all the chance in the world to not have a baby . but of course , they make the unborn suffer the consequence of their idiotic decision ."
what a dehumanising experience for woman in the usa : / another reason i 'd never enter america ever ... my heart go out to the people in america that wanted abortion and we 're denied it what a regressive country ...
boycott america . if they wo n't listen to our voice they 'll listen to our money .

rightly so want abortion then use contraception

"the bbc news doe not appear to know u history or u politics concerning this . democrat use this issue to garner vote . obama ran on the promise that he would codify the ruling , then once in office he stated that he had more important issue to deal with . larry elder did a show on this and showed clip of obama lying and then , after elected , of him giving woman the fu finger on the issue . larry elder also showed an old clip of biden when he had a functioning brain . he wa surprisingly eloquent and though pro-choice , compassionately stated that more help wa needed for sex education , and more so , help wa needed to help pregnant woman to be willing to give birth and not choose abortion a the answer to an unplanned pregnancy . if republican took his stance they would mow down the left in election ."
"u to 13 year old girl : you ca n't adopt a child because you are n't even grown to take care yourself and are n't ready to take care , provide for food , shelter , etc . u to 13 year old girl who 's raped and need to abort the child : abortion is illegal ! ! ! ! it 's so easy for politician to make dumb law and get off everything and continue with their luxurious life after completely ruining and destroying others ."
you tricky witch just want to continue with your human sacrifice under the radar to gain power . it the beginning of the end for all of you . victim of crime should be catered for only .
the religious purist have won !
and furthermore - it 's not a right if to benefit from it you have to take so something from another human life . so ask yourselves if your precious entitlement is worth the life of another creature .
oh i hope the people get the right way to live . i wa thinking much better way to earn money at home anyone with good idea ?
"the reality is that judicial precedent is flaky compared to statute law . the u government ha ducked the issue for 50 year , when they should have legislated the right properly . unfortunately it wa bad law and they would never have got it through both house ."
"to me it 's weird how those anti-abortion people can be so anoying , cant a woman decide what to do if it her body"
"ironic thing is that pro life are gorgeous sexy woman who would be getting laid all the time and would probably need abortion , whilst the pro choice are rough , ugly munters who would only get laid by desperate , suicidal guy and would not really need abortion anyway . funny that is n't it ? !"
pretty soon anyways there will be one world government and new world order and new world religion and many people are about ready to bow to the evil man of sin and lawlessness the antichrist
how much is condom in the usa by the way ?
2:17 '' willing of the people '' ; 21y and she 's afraid of this law ! oh god help me
if you are terrified do n't have sex . sex is optional
woman in china have right to choose . is n't this a part of human right ?
misleading title . the supreme court did nothing of the sort . all they 've done is uphold the right for state to have their own law . abortion is constitutionally not a federal issue .
"they say that they do n't have the fact , when doctor are screaming at them how wrong this is ! ! ! !"
"any woman supporting the overturning of r v w , support tyranny . this is disgusting . they 're going after the gay community and interracial marriage next . oh and the child indian welfare act too . # wakeup # weneedhelp # americaisnotokay"
and it could all be solved by having responsability in your life ... ... you do n't get pregnant by the holy spirit . progressive feminism is all about avoiding a much responsabilirty a possible .
"democracy is definitely going down the toilet ... woman ca n't get tubaligations without male approval , now no more roe v wade , and talk of no birth control pill or long term birth control .... the government will now be ruling woman .... so a half dictatorship since men can get vasectomy without having to obtain permission first . adoption system that is broke . it 's a very sad day in america and probably for a long time to come ."
"the only reason abortion is being banned is money . it cost $ 10,000 to have a baby in a hospital in america . baby = money . america is enslaved . 'nuff said ."
i feel ashame to be human . this is a huge mistake and people are in danger now . shame on you . this is a step back to medevil time .
"so ... if we need law to ensure that woman are treated a equal , doe that mean men are naturally misogynistic ? i 'm so confused ."
this is devastating .
"this is so heartbreaking . i 'm usually very opinionated on political issue , but i honestly do n't know what to believe here . a a woman i understand how terrifying this is , but i 'm conflicted . i hate the idea of people using abortion a a method on contraception and it doe happen . i also hate the idea of coathanger abortion and woman dying . i hate the idea of having to chose between keeping a child that wa a result of a traumatic rape and sending your own offspring into an unjust foster system where they 're likely to experience hardship and their own trauma . there will be so many more baby , making it harder to find responsible people to adopt them . we need to reform the foster system if this is our new reality . the jesus love me people also need to chill , we have freedom of religion and if you pas a law like this it need to be because you think a fetus is a human , not because you 're a religious extremist ."
they will want to ban condom next . because they are killing sperm that would of made life .
mean you want to just enjoy with no responsibility in the name of right . in exceptional circumstance it should be allowed else sustained .
it 's all about control
"the thing is that the free world really need america right now , and america is at war with itself against these extremist religious zealot trying to impose their unreasonable view on everyone . it really is becoming gilead , and making a spectacle of itself and losing all international credibility at the same time . and where doe that leave the rest of the world , with america lost like this ? hopefully not regress to the uk and the root of all this rubbish society ? hopefully it lead the rest of u to see the fruit of basing a society on pillar of greed and vanity , and how like an insidious lie it fester eventually fracture the psyche of a whole civilization to the point they are just at constant war with themselves and cant even function to solve the simplest of civic problem once they become apparent - such a not having citizen shooting up child in classroom for example . seriously please wake up ! !"
"it give you stupid pest 16 week to get an abortion , stop being selfish pig dont worry though youll burn in hell eventually"
"`` i thought this country would still care about woman '' hmmm , do tell , what is a woman ?"
they are not woman they are ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
say god not jesus jesus not god ( dog )
just keep your leg cross why is you go for one knight stand you woman respect your self and do what reall god tell you . not what the filthy bible you have now keep your self pure
i see people saying that they are soical worker and explain and explain how their life will end up badly and our only solution is by murdering them . wow
"something else that ha been overlooked & is terribly sad is this decision will cause a wind back to a time where unsafe home abortion & death of baby in horrible way will be increased to million , instead of in safe hospital or clinic situation ."
"a terribly sad story of forced child birth . a member of my family wa violently raped & tortured , then she wa forced to have the baby by religious anti abortion belief . it led do decade of sorrow & an abandoned baby . the mother wa forced to keep the rapist 's baby , but lost her mind from being forced to have the baby . the baby grew up to have the genetics & violence of the rapist . the mother could not cope with being forced to have the baby & it had to be given to it grand parent where it grew up to beat them & threaten them constantly with vicious attack , causing absolute fear , terrible scar & horror for life . it wa a shocking situation . i dont agree with the vicious way anti abortionist attack woman to take away their right , even though they are trying to give the unborn baby it right instead . the religious & rich morel belief that forced her a a young girl to have this baby under such trauma , are the one responsible for her terrorizing & ongoing torture , & are more responsible for that baby than she wa for being raped a a young girl . she did not want the baby she wa forced . i believe if she had been given the right to choose her own fate over her body , instead of being forced to loose her life from anti abortionist , instead of a life of sorrow & not being able to ever look at that rapist baby , she wa forced to have . she might have had a life instead , perhaps met someone she loved & had her own baby to hold & love instead of being forced to have a rapist baby she wa never able to except or love when she wa a young broken raped girl , which caused her to never have a relationship or love ."
' i 'm 21 and i 'm terrified ! ' ever heard of contraception ?
i mean ... u ... what would you expect from people who believe earth is flat and 5g tower cause covid it no surprise they will get inspired by muslim and let superstition dictate their way of life
"to those who write about adoption service being substandard do a bit of historical sleuthing . sure abandoned kid dont get adopted into decent home ! when roe v wade became law in 73 , by the following year all the gd funding for adoption service dried-up like the vaginal canal of a 60 year old woman ! trust a nurse who know !"
what british moron bbc are . abortion is not only not guaranteed by our constitution ( bbc writer & reporter are so brain dead theyre almost a goofy & senile a biden ) . the word abortion doe not even appear in it !
"your body your choice , then dont get pregnant . use condom take pill you selfish ignorants . all you want is to have sex without talking any responsibility . disgusting ignorants"
when the world is preparing for war we all know that law that prevent a country 's survival will be thrown out the window .
"some of american woman are fighting for thier abortion right , hey ! your lust is the problem .."
"i like trump coz he oppose abortion he is pro life ,"
this video comment section is a battle
it wo n't stop it it will just make it more dangerous
"23/06/22 u lady who miscarried in malta.the baby wa brain dead , the mother in danger of sepsis.abortion is illegal in malta . had to fly to spain for her health care . much like the founding pilgrimswho hung mary dyer , a quaker , who wanted to worship in her own wayrepublicans are pale , stale male .. intolerant and out of touch with reality !"
wow ! god must be sad to see his baby killed . if only you turn to god that he 'll help you with your born baby so you wo n't have to underestimate his power and kill your unborn baby . your conscience which god created in you will follow you all the day of your life ! the regret of killing your own baby in the womb ! a wicked and unrepentant world will face god 's judgement someday ! wake up ! repent !
"how about we stop acting like wild , horny banshee , humping all the time . stop cry about healthcare . healthcare is taking responsibility of your body before you conceive a child then destroy it ! ! !"
why kill the baby when you can use protection during sex . it just make me wonder either the american girls/women never knew bout protection or they just simply want to kill .. i 'd rather have a hysterectomy than killing the innocent soul inside of me .
america is a christian state hence proved
"before exporting democracy to other country , apply democracy to your home ."
"think about this for a second . all of a sudden their decision make a lot more sense . `` the unborn victim of violence act of 2004 ( public law 108-212 ) is a united state law that recognizes an embryo or fetus in utero a a legal victim if they are injured or killed during the commission of any of over 60 listed federal crime of violence . '' so you kick a pregnant mother , she loses the baby ( embryo or fetus ) and it 's a federal crime ... but abortion on demand anywhere in the u is just fine ? ? ? ?"
"i wish those anti-abortion protestors get raped and come pregnant . ooops , i forgot many of them ca n't carry a child ."
"woman say it their body , if it entirely true , when did they make it ? if your mother had followed the same ethos and aborted you , where would you be ? it better to live a sad life for not aborting , than to commit murder , live a freer life but end up in hell torment ."
at how many month is it not ok to abort a baby lefty ?
maybe the eu should make rule for all the country in eu . the president is not king bbc .
the entire supreme court should be an abortion
so if someone is raped they can not abort ? thats just evil
"condom , pill , do n't have sex when drunk ."
look at all them people that support killing baby ! you people that support this our blessed that your love one never had you aborted ! you can live to talk about it ! the baby you support to abort can not live to talk about it ! shame on you ! it a sin just to support it ! every time you support it ! your killing in the eye of god ! do you love satan ?
"it 's okay lady . now when you are getting your vag smashed , just have your cuck boyfriend pull his dick out at the last moment and you wo n't get pregnant . or you could just use condom and or birth control like responsible adult , but your body your choice huh ?"
america be like that drunk guy trying to get home . 2 step forward 5 step backwards
"wait so what if the pregnancy can risk the mother life ? the issue with this ruling is that there is not in between if you go having sex all around and have a baby without protection shame on you and honestly you should be allowed to have an abortion . but if you get raped , or have a baby that will die at birth or the baby birth can potentially kill the mother that 's just not fair . there 's a lot of issue with this on both side and it 's kinda sad tbh"
fyi : the u s constitution ha never guaranteed a woman 's right to an abortion you idiot .
what would you think if your husband ha sex with another woman . his body his choice right ?
ahh the biased bbc of davos clan . yall sure can put out some hit piece garbage propaganda and i dont know how you pull that off with the trusted news initiative thing that started to stop the spread of information .
"* prayer is powerful . please pray for the people who have demon inside them to ban the demon from their body forever in the name of jesus . please pray for all the people to ban all the demon and evil spirit taking over their body mind and heart forever , pea pray for them to receive and turn into the holy spirit god and jesus . pray for all the lost sheep to return home , to jesus- their shepherd . * i pray for them . follow me if you want to do a powerful group community prayer live . * pray also alone daily . please *"
it 's funny how the pro lifer are only pro life till the kid is born then they do n't care if that child is left in a bin or dead or in a hospital . load of people could die from giving birth .
yet this tool bag of a president is set to appoint a judge who is against abortion !
4:18 welcome back to medieval time folk . `` jesus '' is why `` science '' stopped hukanity to progress in first place . usa it 's crumbling one day or another .. sadly
"so if you get raped and pregnant , you have to carry the child to term ? what the fuck"
they killed in a caring way
life life life thank you god
yes it is auch better world
"let face it , the child of an unwanted pregnancy is already dead . all animal need a mother who care . abortion is not saving the child ."
"and suddenly american know exactly what a woman is . i 'd feel sorry for these backward loser , but they brought it on themselves ."
"do fetus have the right to life ? the argument of this essay will prove that abortion is wrong for the same reason that killing a reader of this essay is wrong . i will simply assume , instead of proving , that your murder is seriously wrong . i will make no attempt to offer a full ethic of murder . finally , i will make no attempt to resolve some very basic and difficult general philosophical issue to which this analysis of abortion ethic may lead . the symmetry arising from the analysis of the main argument on both side of the abortion debate may explain why the abortion debate seems difficult . consider the following standard argument against abortion : fetus are both human and alive . people have the right to life . therefore , fetus have the right to life . of course , woman have the right to control their own body , but the right to life go beyond a woman 's right to control her own body . therefore , abortion is wrong . the fetus ' right to life doe not include his right to use someone else 's body to preserve his life . however , an opponent of abortion may point out that a woman 's right to use her body doe not include her right to end someone else 's life in order to do what she want with her body . in response , one might argue that a pregnant woman 's right to control her body is not much , if it is wrong , to take any action that end the life of the fetus within her . however , an opponent of abortion may argue that the fetus ' right to life doe not come much if a pregnant woman can end it when she chooses . the consequence of all these symmetry seems to be a stalemate . but if we have an attitude , then one could argue that we are left with a conflict of right , a fetal right to life versus a woman 's right to control her body . one could then argue that the right to life seems to be a stronger right than the right to control one 's own body in the case of abortion , because the loss of one 's life is a greater loss than the loss of the right to control one 's own body , a respect for nine month . therefore , the right to life prevails over the right to control one 's own body and abortion is wrong ."
it seems state are tired of paying for peep that lay down with no responsibility .
life is respected and valued again .
so this is the american freedom lmao
what the fuck america
a nation destroyed by it enemy can rise againbut the one which crumbles from within thats dead
abortion right are human right .
right arent right if someone can take them away . theyre privilege . thats all weve ever had in this country is a bill of temporary privilege . george carlin .
banning abortion just creates a new welfare state . if you cant trust a woman with a decision how can you possibly trust her with a child ?
happy for supream court desicion . now boy will think before going in with girl and girl also will think 100 time before going in with any boy a if a child is born than they will have the responsibility and cant shrug the responsibility to take care of child . it god justic to the unborns baby who are alive in womb and these female they just go and murder them . god is good . and so the usa court
whats that song ? it a man worlddd
"biden always up there lookin clueless lmao . slow speech , look like he about to fall over lol ."
"my advise is to ignore video that wo n't allow comment . that 's what i do ! if the public ca n't post comment on the narcissistic wannabe god forum , then it 's not even worth wasting your time to visit . this one doe allow comment . okay ! i 'm pro-life and against making a meat market out of the remains of what wa supposed to become a human being . clump ? no ! that 's not just clump ! that is the remains of a potential person ! even a person who dy from natural cause deserves a proper funeral and/or burial . it 's disgusting !"
it not the baby fault . adult let do better
omg these woman are all 26 year old virgin scared for the world law & politics shouldnt revolve around religious belief
"well , enjoy your rape spawn america"
it a bunch of fat woman who will never get laid
there is no way people are this uneducated
3:13 actually roe made the u.s. an outlier . most country ban abortion between 12-20 week . france ban it at 14 week which mean mississippi is more liberal than france . the extremism ha always come from the left on this issue .
seems like america is slowly crumbling away
"in arcansaw they will soon ban invitro fertilization . but no abortion for rape pregnancy . make sense ? whole bunch of pro lifer , in the next 6 month will be stunned at what come down the pipe next in red state . iud , bc , plan b gone . invitro fertilization gone . some already are already saying they didnt know there wa a bigger agenda . ya . theocracy . the only thing contraception , contraception , invitro have in common is theocrats hate them . they have no idea who they pushed into power . theyll freak out when it restricts their life ."
there no excuse for murder
so know no vasectomy for men is this where we 're headed
"a woman carry a child at the cost of her health and future , so only every woman can decide whether to have an abortion or not , and not the state . by banning abortion , you will only put woman at risk , abortion will be done anyway . a woman is more important than an embryo . and by the way , at the stage of abortion , someone is not yet a living being ."
"great day to be an american , pro life all the way ."
"hold on just a dad gum second there bbc news ! the supreme court did not make abortion illegal . it remanded the authority , quite properly , back to the state where it belongs . now each state legislature will decide on their law . the u once again is a federation of sovereign state . the federal government never had the power to order the state to make abortion legal never . stop with the clickbait headline ."
why not being more self responsible and not getting pregnant are the women/girls that undisciplined
why not be more responsible in not getting pregnant are you woman that undisiplined
you tube censoring my opinion
amen unbelievable # s of aborted child let mother pregnant in the first place responsibly reasonability aware of how to prevent conception
peaceful protest by baby killer ......
men should get a vasectomy till they decide they are ready for kid ! ! ! that should be made standard procedure once abortion is outlawed
yeah let gooooo ruining people life and causing adult death . whoooooooooooooooooooo fuck these people life because it murder and so what if ive never had to deal with it but it meed to he a perfect world for u stupid woman in america yeeeeeeeeeeehhaaaahahahahahaha a someone from britain i find this so funnily stupid on how there ruining young people life and cant wait for this to end up like prohibition with alcohol . also god damn if someone doesnt want to have a baby let them have an abortion and stop doing what you want think about what other people think .
good news . abortion should be a crime .
"oh yes a law that need to be looked over , same sex marriage are you kidding me"
right to abortion ? care received ? so killing your baby is caring for him or her . the bbc is always biased in such matter
"abortion wa prohibited during communist era in romania and we ended up to have so many orphan kid in our society ... and woman can still do abortion themselves at home , which is very dangerous and can led to death . a lot of woman died innocently from husband-spouse blackmailed social relation ... is true that is not moral to abort , but it is the parent sin .. it is not something you can have control over it , better help people do it right at least"
so now there is a definition of a woman ? thats the most hypocritical response that woman made that the woman is ok being beaten and raped a long a she can have an abortion ? why not help the woman a safe place to stay or take her in .
ok if the government plan wa to create a new type of abortion that is le 'violent ' would n't they overturn this right after they found that 'less violent way ' ? just asking .
"i really can not overstate how much this both enrages and unnerves me . enrages because it represents a massive step back for american society that put million at risk and unnerves because it set a very dangerous precedent . if the abortion landmark ruling can be overturned so easily , what of the ruling that solidified contraception , repealed sodomy law and legalised gay marriage ? i also find this ruling to be extremely hypocritical . the procedure is called murder , but the child born are at risk of being murdered in their classroom and there 's never any huge reaction prompted to stop that . there is no exception in any case , even if an underage girl get raped by her grandfather . it will drive woman to desperate and potentially fatal method of abortion where they can no longer access safe and legal procedure . the woman forced to bear child they ca n't care for or do n't want , it will affect their mental health . america is regressing before our very eye and mark my word , it is not going to stop here ."
"it make me sad that pro-abortion people always want to justify there position by saying that if a person is poor , they should not have the right to life . if a person is disabled , they do not deserve to live , it 's too inconvenient to care for them . even joe biden , what he essentially said is that black baby should only live if there parent are well off .... do they ever really think about what they are saying ? the quality of life should not determine the right to life ! they always default to rape victim a the silver bullet ... why do n't we make the death sentence for the rapist and not let the child pay for the sin of the father ... how quickly will rape be minimized and how empowering would it be for the victim ( mother and child ) to know that justice have been served . pro-life can exercise the death sentence because the violator made there choice and if the god-ordained justice system say death is the consequence for them , so be it . the truth of what the pro-abortion people really want is for woman to live a undisciplined men who want to practice promiscuity without consequence . `` my body , my choice = i want sex without responsibility . not reality ! it take two to have sex and limiting or dare eliminate unnatural abortion will cause men and woman to think twice . if you do n't want to have a child with that person , you do n't want to have child support , then think twice ... that 's the choice right there ! there 's a difference between a natural abortion ( miscarriage ) v selective ( unnatural ) abortion . god give life and he ha the right to take it away ... no one else !"
the bbc dont like democracy .
tellurian stock please do something about this souki is big con man he is been stealing investor money with lie he should go to jail life time all the investor lost the money souki stolen all the money
ok i dont like abortion but if it to save a woman life then it should be legal for that case if a little girl wa raped it should be legal but a 1 night stand is ur on fault they can go to adoption center but the little girl and the one that will lose there life without should have every right to live
in u you have a right to buy a gun but when you are a rape victim or any f .. reason to have an abortion no what a rotten stupid world eeeew
i am not 100 % with abortion but what about rape victim and woman that they are in danger and giving birth will kill them . shaaaaaaaame
"it called responsibility ! if you dont want a baby , than have safe sex , and there are many way ano 2022 ."
i like how she say anti and pro abortion . not pro life and pro choice that shit is confusing
stupidity what about the woman and young girl that get raped your law are flawed the new normal all the woman are raped so they have to have child from being raped stupidity
"woman should have the right to choose whether they should cancel their pregnancy or not . making it illegal is going to cause more bad than good . drug to kill the baby and damage the mom , unadopted kid crammed in home , homeless and jobless young adult , kid abused because they were unwanted or caused by rape , young teen killed by birth , population spike , and much much more . this isnt a democratic country decision ; it should be up to the person ."
"in case of rape , ok i get it , but i know some people that do it just cause they do n't like using protection and many other reason other than being responsible , so i think it should be allowed only in special case not else ."
"hey american people just a reminder . dont worry too much if you cant get an abortion . just be patient cause in your blessed country , youll just have to wait a few year until this kid you didnt want get shot at school"
"woman should choose if they want to be mother or not and get professional help if they decide for breaking the pregnancy . abortion is not murder , abortion is woman 's right to live their life how they want and have proper and legal medical help if needed ."
i can see how it would be hard for a nation who requires a license to buy a fork to understand making your own decision .
what do pro lifer think about arkansas and michigan banning abortion even if someone ha beeen raped
what if a woman who been raped request an abortion but no one belief shes been raped even though she ha been ? wtf happens to her
it 's not a right
woman will die woman will die woman will die woman will die how is life winning ? when you have a dead miscarried baby making you septic and the doctor too busy talking to his lawyer to realize youre already dead .
"imagine your daughter get raped , what then , are you willing to raise the child , your daughter resents , from the father who ruined her life forever ?"
it 'll be interesting to watch the blue state . in the past some democrat in red state have advocated for the mother right to terminate the child day or week after birth . it would be just like them to try to enact this now a a `` we 'll show you '' . i 'll be watching . i guess we 'll have to call it postpartum abortion .
these pro life people are seriously delusional ... i live in south africa it been legal since apartheid ended and is free in state hospital i have friend who 've had abortion and it saved their life and mental health .
amerikkka descending into christofascism . and the yank wonder why china ha come up so fast ?
`` life won today ''
we should be thankful to donald trump for this
"usa is truly backwards , old as people who arent even doctor get to decide over abortion rule . the fact that rape and incest is not a cause for abortion is actually retarded to a level i ca n't even understand ."
thanks be to god ... congratulation people in america .
abortion can not be right in ay way . it is sin
"so , how can you guarantee an unwanted child would live in a well loving family and wo n't get neglect or face domestic violence that every child should n't be facing"
"u supreme court 's decision just show how ridiculous usa is and doe live in some other reality . in other word , outside of this world . only totally fool make decision like that ."
baby life matter too ! it may not be a happy day for fornicator but it 's a happy day for baby .
"a if the world doe n't have enough people . this will just create more unwanted baby , more resource shortage . not to mention the medical risk woman had to face if they have pregnancy complication ."
abortion is equal to a murder of innocent child and every woman who commit it should be publicly executed
"i hope miscarriage on these pro lifer . carry and birth dead baby , then open your big , fat mouth ."
"is there anyone who doesnt know that condom doe not prevent 100 % of pregnancy ! what if a woman got pregnant from a hookup should she just accept this result and destroy her own life ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? if u still think abortion is murder , sure , get ready to pay childcare or stop having casual sex ."
this is so crazy . people who are against abortion didnt win anything but all the people who are now forced to have a baby or to get an illegal and dangerous abortion lost everything . there are just two option : control over a uterus by the state or control over a uterus by woman themselves . why do people think the state ha a greater right in this ? ?
close your leg until marriage and this would n't be a problem ! ! 99 % just wan na have a fun lol
"disingenuous at best , bbc . it no longer a federal right , but it can still be approved on a state level a far a i know . so it not banned ."
i think this a personal decision that should be left to the individual to make for themselves . everyone 's in different circumstance in life and this could ruin lot of people life . i do n't think it 's a decision people would make lightly to have an abortion but some people just are n't in the wright place for child . it should n't be a crime in my opinion and there probably going through enough without having the added stress of being criminalised by other people who carnt emperthise .
"what if an unmarried young girl get pregnancy , which may be an obstacle to her career ... it mean , men have more chance to get benefit from various way . am i sure , is this announced from supreme court of u.s. thank god , u.s supreme court is not in india ."
congratulation supreme court just did a good job . abortion is evil and shouldnt have been allowed in this country .
yay baby life matter ! !
"daily mass shooting with no plan to ban assault rifle , law that take right away from woman , a police force that abuse black , unchecked border .... welcome to america folk lmao ."
life start at conception not perception . abortion is murder .
pro life yes yes . thank you god . ex muslim here after saw jesus lord amen hallelujah hallelujah
if biological male had to give birth abortion would have remained an unalienable right !
handmade tail . under his eye
bible bashers are the most destructive people on earth . kill religion .
oh i just love the sound of brainwashed drone cheering a they happily give up our right . lovely . the best part wa when they sang about jesus . good to know that christian lose their ever-loving shit at the very inkling of anyone pushing their belief on them . but they 'll dance and rejoice when they get to shove their religion up my uterus . how hypocritically hysterical .
"the ignorance of people is appalling ... well , pro life crowd should pay to raise all the unfortunate kid that will be born in terrible situation . trump is such an ignorant human ... he literally just said he know what god want ? ? disgusting liar son of a rotten system . `` america '' should n't even exist ! forget about being great again cause it never wa ... you do not build a real nation using slavery and killing a a starting point ! how can you be pro life and also pro gun at the same time ? a few week ago child died because of gun . the system can not even protect those already born and here it is a crowd saying that is what god want . what a joke ."
i like how people in the comment are like `` oh just stop having sex '' . what about men then ? will they stop having sex ? i guess not
where are basic human right ? ? ?
abortion should only be allowed if the mother 's life is in clinical danger
thank god for that because it their body but the babie in the womb life not theirs life & all the glory to god in jesus name hallelujah and amen
"good it is not your right to kill child or people with the time you have been blessed with while your on earth ....... lot of hell bound people protesting , the pleasure of the flesh have taken over there mind there forgetting about the wooden box to come ......"
great news ! now how shall we punish woman for choosing to do something to their body ? i wa thinking life with parole if they snitch on their doctor and it 's before 16 week and the death penalty for abortion after that . that 'll make woman birth unwanted child or child of their abuser .
"you are here today because your mom decided to keep you , so shut up and say thanks"
the scotus did n't ban abortion ..
"they forgot to mention , that if your daughter are raped , molested , or there is incest in a family . that she cant not have a abortion if she doesnt want to carry a sick man baby . so rite there they assume they can take away parent rite at the same time . no way it is between daughter , mother & father . not the conservative ( rite-wing ) there people that have trouble with pregnancy , by the time the dr. get thee ok then she can get help it could be 10-12 hr . later by that time she could die . this is sick . it like now they think they can decide if you live or die . these people dont read , they just put out what they want they dont check history out there static"
the fairy story of free west world is collapsing . we soon learn that africa is more free that u
time to raise an army .
prayes the lord in jesus name god almighty still is on the throne amen
abortion is banned . the state can decide on how to deal with abortion .
"the prohibition on alcohol did not work out well . i think abortion ban will make abortion even more dangerous because it will be done secretly by perhaps untrained people or dangerous method . going forward , the u might become a theocracy ."
this would not have happened under trump
"i can see a load of baby being dumped once they are born ,"
why woman 's life decided by men !
abortion are wrong you dirty scumbags fuck you
we are not a christian nation . separation of church and state ? this is sad and wrong ! it 's not about pro life it 's pro birth . improve the quality of life for those already here ! ! i 'm embarrassed to call this country my home .
unborn baby is a human being killing baby in the woman womb is a murderer
i am so heartbroken : - ( ( why ? why did the country i so looked up to for inspiration and freedom take such a regressive step ? i 'm so dejected . : - ( ( ( (
"feel sorry for the u , this ruling is completely insane and based on what a bunch of religious nut job want ."
my comment are getting deleted by the politically correct brigade you
these dumb a $ $ liberal are still tlking about abortion like it 's a `` constitutional right ''
it quite a contradiction - one can never kill a baby outside the womb but can do so to one in the womb . doe a baby have a right to it own body too . i know it a complicated issue and there are no easy answer when it come to rape and a mother life is in danger -
in a country where free sex is so rampant . illegalising abortion may not be the right thing . atleast make it flexible case by case . and create a culture of family value and le free sex then applying the illegal abortion rule will make sense .
we live in a very bad time were freak are taking over the world soon men will be able too bear kid
"bbc is lying to you ! ! this decision doe not make abortion illegal in the usa , and i wish that wa the case ! ! this decision merely allows each individual state and the voter decide whether or not abortion is legal or what parameter there will be . only leftist extremist would argue that state should not decide these issue locally !"
"abortion brought the u.s. down on a communal l level , a personal level and a spiritual level . the country ha turned from god and killed many potential human life . this turning from god ha caused the plague prophesied by john the revelator in the book of revelation ."
fake news- it go back to the state level where it belongs .
my girlfriend wa in foster care . she is against it . the system fails them most of them commit suicide . free country my as . the catholic are trying to take it over like they did in the past . it a cult . anyone who want to come to the usa . dont . it becoming a nazi nation under christian law
dont get why ppl or so selfish yes it ur body but that it a life u getting rid of a child doesnt life matter it seem like life doesnt matter anymore
rape : exist unwilling pregnancy : exist abortion : illigal
illegal abortion just went up 1 million percent
the population already out of control anyways this is not good
ok so why are only woman mad about this ? men historically pay for baby anyway
no state health car . the right to bear arm . criminalised abortion . why doe one nation want so many of it living citizen to die ?
"pro life advocate are hypocrite . they care nothing about the life of innocent child ; if they did , they would be out in the street protesting all the bomb that have been dropped in iraq__ over 500,000 child killed in that war . and what about yemen and all the million killed by violence and starvation , and you heard nothing coming from these so called `` religious fanatic '' . they do n't care about innocent life , they only cheer , fervently , the military 's catastrophic , nightmarish policy in the middle east ."
"abortion is evil , if you do this willingly , you are going to hell 100 % . you just wish that you may never ever been born , while yoy are tormented in hell ..."
so .. shit is n't a shit until it leaf your arse . hmmm interesting .
"the `` victory '' being crowed over by the `` life '' brigade ( who , if you checked their home , would all be found to own multiple gun ) is in fact , the imposition of a religious ideology upon people who do not share their belief system . this , despite the fact that the bill of right explicitly state that the government ( congress ) `` shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof '' . i guess technically it 's not congress forcing u to all live according to one fanatical branch of christianity 's interpretation of a word here & there in the bible . however , congress put these bozo into the supreme court . many people do not believe the soul enters the body until birth , and therefore , the foetus is not a live human being ."
"why not to split into two country ? abortion and no abortion , holding gun and no gun ."
"i am pro-life but denial of abortion in case of rape , incest , or medically proven severe genetic condition in the fetus is just wrong ."

"a if people do n't have enough to deal with a it is , struggling with record high inflation and poverty a the world recovers from an economically devastating pandemic , they throw this absurd decision in the mix , to even further divide the nation into more conflict and protest . all based on their personal religious belief . idiot ! ! ! ! !"
this begs the $ 64.00 question ... where is 'the right to an abortion ' enumerated in the usc ?
"abortion is a heinous crime , why are these baby victim paying the price for your stupid mistake and being cut into piece ? ! ! ! where are the human right that you all talking about , you all hypocrite , i do n't understand why there are so many people against the decision to abolish abortion ... how can you kill an innocent soul ? ! ! everyone know only solution to this problem is to stay away from adultery and immorality , then no unwanted pregnancy will occur and no innocent baby will be killed anymore ... you know that there are 20 million abortion that took place in europe this year so sad . in islam , adultery and immorality are prohibited , abortion and infanticide are prohibited . islam preserve all right . indeed , it is a religion of mercy"
"finally some news with progress of our civilization . do n't want child ? do n't have sex , it 's that simple . if you 're raped then i 'm ok with abortion ."
"ban abortion , 2 legged tuna keep them leg closed , you stink"
apart from medical reason 's i agree with the court
is n't an unborn baby a human life too ? !
good job supreme court . abortion must be kept to the minimum and only case of emergency when the woman 's life is at risk . i sympathize with woman who get raped and end up pregnant . but a fetus is a human being and simply ca n't be killed because he ha no voice
woman who are for abortion have already been born ....
"woman giving birth wa fatal not that long ago we have all had it too easy , this is a great advancement to re-establish respect for each other and learning once again to take life seriously ."
i feel like the only reason the ban are happening is bc abortion is basically removing a child like is a tumor and some people dont like that . i dont agree or disagree im neutral
a life a life who gave u the right to decide who life and who dy .. i wouldnt want that on my conscience
use protection : .the end .
right to abortion ? ! ! ! what about child 's right to life ? ! ! !
in korea we have baby box woman put baby in the baby box so baby can live . the pastor take the baby and take care baby .
"tell it how it actually is , bbc"
human cant protect their child in their worm .. so the govt help them . why dont we abort these people who support abortion
"jesus is the way the truth and the life ... # yes to gun control ! # end abortion ! # human right and climate change ... # end corruption , crime , drug cartel and terrorism ."
the war on the people continues .
"there is no justification to abortion , people should take responsibility and be cautious the first place , prevention is better than cure . leaning towards the pro-life choice ."
"u ha gone back in time , interms of human right ."
"the law here in australia are somewhat different to the u . my partner and i have been together 27 year now , from the moment we got together way back when she stated she never wanted kid ! shes not maternal at all . anyway after a year being together and her trialling a few different contraceptive pill , she got preggers and she wa on the pill ! her decision wa easy a it wa only 4 week and our doctor agreed on the abortion and after all these year we still believe it wa the right thing to do a we both never wanted kid . i think that it not selfish but rather responsible a the child would not have been wanted or loved and possibly hand balled to someone else ? so it just go to show that contraception most certainly is not foolproof . i still think woman should have the right to abort within a certain time frame ."
liberal are hurt . use some burnol .
the 21 year old is terrified because she love to get smashed without protection lol
it disturbing that not once did they mention that for mother turned away a child get to live .
so the catholic church now rule even if you are not catholic !
how about they give all the unwanted child to the judges/ politician who caused this mess ? i 'm sure they quickly change their mind if they are forced to care for a little human .
"you should n't know our recent history , yet all of america is forgetting very recent history . dem 's have had dozen of opportunity to put this in our constitution . led by obama 's run up to getting elected a second term where every speech he famously said , `` if elected my very first day in office i will codify abortion '' . then upon winning the immediate reply wa , `` it 's not on the top of my list of priority '' . i think they never made this a federal law from thinking it would never happen . also a little over a third strongly oppose abortion , putting of enough they may not be elected . but only they know why . and nobody should call this group anything but pro-zygote . now when an expectant woman ha a complication she ca n't go out of state no matter the money . like a tubular pregnancy , or a zygote dy in the womb . now a surgeon wo n't touch her . pregnancy in america now is a death sentence . guess there 's reason why no medium is reporting these obvious fact and most recent history . the dems only answer is for u to vote harder . we have ! why have n't you done your job democrat ? yet all you will hear in any medium is it 's chump 's fault , or blame the supreme court and these violent pro-zygote supporter . just some truth and history nobody mention because they all have agenda outside truth . seems we are doomed to keep repeating history . & to everyone !"
wow what a dick this is trump 's fault . appointing 3 judge who are against abortion
bbc you suck as .
oh my goooood the right to abortion wasnt struck down they just gave it to the state to decide . how doe a official news channel mess that up that badly ?
this is absolutely crazy .
"the judge actually appealed to the law to strike down roe v wade , not christian theology or secular morality . the 14th amendment actually doe recognise the privacy and individuality of a foetus . and because it not possible to hold a foetus accountable for anything , you can not justify abortion unless in case where it not possible to carry to term and survive . but i highly doubt any state , no matter how theological they are , will go to this length . the only reason roe v wade wa struck down is because the people voted on the politician to do so , and those same people hold a pretty moderate view on the subject . but even then , roe v wade wa always poorly reasoned ."
the most dumbest decision by a so called democratic country ! just what are the supreme court judge thinking ? what if the one affected is thier own ? probably then they will understand and it so important that state and religion remains separate . if mixed then hell will break loose .
"el salvador 's abortion ban : ' i wa sent to prison for suffering a miscarriage' by will grant bbc news , san salvador , el salvador"
"criminalising abortion isnt going to stop them happening , it going to send them underground . woman will start dying because of unsafe procedure or self-induced abortion- and this is the american dream ? nevermind the sheer number losing their life because of incredibly painful , life threatening complication when they will no longer have the right to the cure they need . it madness honestly ."
crazy bible thumpers .
they can not eliminate a fundamental human right ! the right of a woman to decide for her life and health is still there ! but those 3 `` judge '' could violate and did violate this right ! and that is a crime ! it 's outrageous ! but i 'm sure it wo n't last long !
god had give strength to these judge to do the right choice
so many beautiful baby are killed by their own mother thats so sad
"anti choice people are not pro life , if it wa they would take care of the woman and the baby once there born . alot dont they care whelst there in the womb once there out they dont give a toss"
abortion is murder simple
i thought that men can get pregnant and we have 64 different gender you can identify with . ca n't define what a woman is . now when roe vs. wade wa overturned ... all of a sudden the term `` woman '' is alive and well again . abortion is just plain murder of a human being . in california ... if you shot and killed a pregnant woman ... it 's considered double murder . how about if that woman is getting an abortion when she got murdered ? ? ? ?
thanks president trump
it 's good news for me to see that america 's freedom is killing child
not sure where in the constitution it say abortion is a right ? maybe under privacy but that is a reach . passing a bill will be more efficient way of making this a law . obama had a super majority in 2009 and did not wish to pa the law .
"let them get a many abortion a they want . in fact , speed it up . it 's exactly the kind of people i wish did n't exist ."
"if a man cant get pregnant how come they are there protesting . oh yeah , it only men who disagree with you that are bad ."
right to kill baby overturned
america . where if you get raped you are forced to have that baby just to raise it up and send them to a school to be massacred .. backwards as country .
wow .... imagine a civilised democracy outlawing child murder .... disgusting ... lol
"it not just about abortion , ,what trigger me is how easily they can come up with their own decision on woman 's body"
"in plain english , those imagery right conjured out of the 14th and 9th amendment by political court instead of doing them the right way via the congress and amendment are now in jeopardy . the learning point is do it the right way and a supreme court that follows the constitution will not be able pop your balloon . maybe the bbc will understand this language . perhaps someone at the bbc could obtain a copy of the united state constitution ? the decision on abortion will now return to the state and the people of those state who elect their representative , where it ha always belonged until a rogue court changed that in the 1970 's . that ha now been fixed . it is amazing the number of uninformed people making fool of themselves showing their lack of basic understanding of the constitution of the united state . least we forget the largest abortion business in america wa founded by a racist whose aim wa the elimination of those `` weed '' a she put it of the human race , i.e . black , asian and anyone not white . margaret sanger wa a racist . funny how most of the abortion clinic were placed in black community a wa most of the baby killed . that doe not get mentioned a much in the video ."
american are really dramatic ..... they are protesting to be allowed to kill innocent child that they split their leg very joyfully for ... wtf these clown always amuse me
if it life risk for the mom then ok but otherwise use condom
"this small devil woman is still in favor of abortion not knowing how evil abortion is , shedding of blood , maybe shedding of blood is what plea the devil , but i pray that that ruling must permanently in america , small nation will also follow suit to ban abortion at all cost"
"wonderful .. god bless america , , this ruling will save more life on this universe"
"absolute rubbish , bbc lie again . you believe a baby aborted at 8.5 month is good . madness ! ! ! give the fact , explain the case to the viewer . shameful"
what happened to separating church and state ? to all the people bringing religon b into this
the death rate of woman and newborn in state that have banned abortion ha risen . this mean there will be more orphan . this is just insanity for which there is no explanation .
"ignorant , narrow minded people applauding this ruling ."
"in the usa , you have the right to hunt . imagine if peta ha such a great campaign that they convinced a huge number of people in the usa that hunting wa a sin -- evil . killing animal is a sin . having gun to kill animal is a sin . so the supreme court see the argument and agrees . killing animal -- especially animal that are not even predator , should be made illegal in the usa . so this ruling come down . now ... you are a gun owner , and you can shoot at little target of people or animal , but it would be absolutely illegal to actually shoot an animal with your gun . anyone doing that ha committed animal murder and thus should be arrested with their gun confiscated . if your religion ha you believing that this is sin , then you might be able to get that law passed in a sort of sneaky way where your supreme court judge lie about past precedent about hunting . watch powder . good movie ."
6 political appointee affected the right to decide what a woman ha the right to do with her own body . 6 people decided the right of 340 million people . this ha to change .
this is pathetic ... i mean goodness gracious this stupid country just keep making mistake after mistake ... i feel like now is a good time to leave before something terrible happens ...
it 's ok if you do n't like abortion . but your feeling ca n't decide others right to abortion . that 's it .
those people who are anti-abortion are deranged and mentally unstable . this country is fkced up . note that reasonable christmas are pro choice .
abortion in not right it murder
"an elected legislator is not an in built majority . you could say that for the democrat too , but it wouldnt be reported that way . imo ."
"preg mother should have the right to decide their baby , do not force them to suicide"
"our own president disagreeing with our highest court . even if the president disagrees with the decision , he should not publicly voice his disagreement ."
i love baby too ! take care of and love all people ... what about all the unwanted child in foster care ? ... healthcare for all ... end homelessness ... clean up the ocean ... plant more tree ... clean drinking water and enough food for everyone ... stop making the rich richer ... enough for everyone ... normalize equality .... era- equal right amendment ... equality ... normalize equality ... era- equal right amendment ... equality ... normalize equality ... era- equal right amendment ... equality ...
same sex marriage should be banned forever too . it is disturbing the fundamental gender and bringing so much confusion to ppl and growing child .
them : gun should be banned ! u : killing baby should be banned too ! them : wait what ! ? ? u : we can play this game too
to all the dumbass the law clearly stats it up to the state to decide for example if she wa a rape victim and dosent want a rape child they can allow her to have an abortion .
any you fuchtards ever think about wearing a condom or being on birth control ? you all about the dumbest people ever .
they slay their baby 's in the belly just like the bible said
best decision in 50 yr
abortion=kill . replace the word abortion with kill and listen to what she u saying .
woman need to be protected . except them god damn baby .
abortion doctor talking about human right is like a slave owner talking about human right
abortion is murder period !
i dont even know what party im watching anymore i just like watching news
people who protested for woman right in the 70 must feel so insulted right now
so happy to see roe go down in flame
funny how they do n't ban gun but they can ban abortion
i wonder if illegal abortion are a thing now
all this pro-life attitude but everyone can have a gun . just yesterday someone shot two people in alabama because they did n't put mayonnaise on his sandwich at the restaurant . great job america .
"abortion is wrong , it ha good intention however . ppl use it a birth control so it 's time to get rid of the law and change a few detail ."
"i 'm not pro-murdering baby . i 'm pro-becky who found out at her 20-week anatomy scan that the infant she had been so excited to bring into this world had developed without life sustaining organ . i 'm pro-susan who wa sexually assaulted on her way home from work , only to come to the horrific realization that her assailant planted his seed in her when she got a positive pregnancy test result a month later . i 'm pro-theresa who hemorrhaged due to a placental abruption , causing her parent , spouse , and child to have to make the impossible decision on whether to save her or her unborn child . i 'm pro-little cathy who had her innocence ripped away from her by someone she should have been able to trust and her 11-year-old body is n't mature enough to bear the consequence of that betrayal . i 'm pro-melissa who 's working two job just to make end meet and ha to choose between bringing another child into poverty or feeding the child she already ha because her spouse walked out on her . i 'm pro-brittany who realizes that she is in no way financially , emotionally , or physically able to raise a child . i 'm pro-emily who went through ivf , ending up with six viable implanted egg requiring selective reduction to ensure the safety of her and a safe number of fetus . i 'm pro-jessica who is finally getting the strength to get away from her physically abusive spouse only to find out that she is carrying the monster 's child . i 'm pro-vanessa who went into her confirmation appointment after year of trying to conceive only to hear silence where there should be a heartbeat . i 'm pro-lindsay who lost her virginity in her sophomore year with a broken condom and now ha to choose whether to be a teenage mom or just a teenager . i 'm pro-courtney who just found out she 's already 13 week along , but the egg never made it out of her fallopian tube so either she terminates the pregnancy or risk dying from internal bleeding . you can argue and say that i 'm pro-choice all you want , but the truth is : i 'm pro-life . their life . woman 's life . you do n't get to pick and choose which scenario should be accepted . it 's not about which story you do n't agree with . it 's about fighting for the woman in the story that you do agree with and the choice that wa made . woman 's right are meant to protect all woman , regardless of their situation ! overturning roe doe not stop abortion , it stop safe abortion ! abortion is healthcare ."
imagine cry because you want to kill innocent baby
this remove me from watching bbc . it 's never been constitional .
apparently my wife body belongs to jesus christ so i will leave her alone now
"the gop know they wo n't win in 2024 , and their majority senate and house wo n't last long so their doing everything they can get away with now before it 's too late ."
the people who like this is just f ..... up .. ! ! ! this again show why usa is not the country to control the world ! ! again ... this is so wrong .... how can you be so naive ! !
not every woman deserves to be allowed to have abortion ! some woman need to take responsibility of their action cause it not right to sleep around and to have one after another abortion . in case of emergency and rape yes it okay . but when woman keep making same choice without thinking the consequence then they should definitely deal with the result that come with the choice they make ! no child deserves to die . it just so selfish and these woman keep making same mistake again and again without concern of innocent child involved ! no one ha right to end another life with their foolish choice !
abortion is not a reproductive right since reproduction ha already taken place .
"keep those draw on lady ! no more casual sex ! no more do over ! you break it you buy it ! think twice before you do it ! abortion should be for rape , kid and incest victim ! not for irresponsible woman who live their life with their leg open for every tom , dick and hank ! keep those leg closed and those panty on ! it 's not just the man 's fault ! a woman will only allow concession to a man when she want him to have it ! rape is something totally different so do n't go screaming rape and blaming him for every damn thing when you allowed him to enter your home , take you to the hotel , make out with you in the car , and finger bang you ! this supreme court ruling is a wake up call for those from both sex who ca n't keep their draw on and their dick in their pant ! ! !"
"congrats to the u . there will be a lot of woman , especially teenage girl , suffering thanks to these irresponsible idealist imposing their belief on others ."
"no unborn man will get an opinion on this a he cant give birth , , , something say acceptable abortion basically ignores society 's problem , , it clearly sad that so meny think it ok , , not exactly natural is it , , , obviously there should be exemption and so on , , , certainly rape , , it clearly a mess"
so abortionist and 2nd amendment advocate fight the same fight now . enjoy
jesus love all the little child ... all the child of the world

biden the worst president of the history of the united estate !
"more goverment control ! ! should have been a clause to allow abortion in case of rape ! ! ! period ! ! ! ! i am not a damn democrap and not very much a republican but i believe there should have been allowance for rape but not to be paid for by the goverment ! ! ! if you need an abortion because of rape or if it 's your life or the baby 's , then you should pay for it youself , not expect the gov to pay for it ! ! ! and i really do n't give a shit who like what i said or not ! ! ! ! !"
"the u is one of the few nation who are not facing the population bomb . china , and russia are imploding because they do n't have any young people . this is a real problem for many nation . nation who let abortion rule the day , are literally running out of enough young people , to run their nation . people are an asset to any nation . when a nation 's old people , out number the young , it is literally dying . the immorality of abortion ha a high price ."
"a a trans woman in the uk , i can not say there are many thing i am happy about with our government . our government being not so closely linked to the church a america however , is certainly one of them ."

"isnt a woman period technically like an abortion or am i not smart , im probably just not smart ."
"religion and politics should have no connection , they are too different thing"
"all i 'm seeing are euphemism , the `` procedure '' goal is to kill the child , no it 's not to end the pregnancy since a c-section is n't an abortion , the goal of a c-section is opposite of the goal of an abortion . when someone say `` woman 's right '' ask , `` the right to do what ? '' . make them admit the to the actual goal ."
is right to abortion anywhere in the constitution ?
a tragic step backwards for woman .
"most time it amazes me greatly the way i moved from an average lifestyle to earning over 63k per month , utter shock is the word . i have understood a lot in the past few year to doubt that opportunity abound in the financial market , the only thing is to know where to focus ."
do these people think our country is better off with more unwanted child ? that seems unnecessarily abusive to those kid . we will have a lot more traumatized child in the future
n the future same sex marriage will ban also n america .
america ! the land of freedom and hope . disgusting !

"this will only result in the eventual establishment of a new amendment , backfiring against the fool who do n't understand what safe abortion mean to the world , and causing untold number of atrocity in the meantime ."
"in the same time the court rule in two case first case you do not have control over my gun second case i have control over your body ( you do not have control over your body ) this is why the christian democrat do n't want christian hypocrite to rule this country , so we do not go to the stone age like iran , afghanistan.etc . the history of abortion law in america religious community member talk god and abortion : )"
how would an abortion stop someone from beating someone else up ?
i would love to see the same outpouring of feeling against the death penalty
"so , basically in america , woman have right but not to their body . am i hearing that right because the reason england made it legal to stop illegal underground abortion which resulted in more woman dying then the foetus she wa carrying and some woman were unable to have child after those illegal abortion . the result were this 25 % lived and could still have child . 25 % lost the ability to have child and finally 50 % died from underground abortion . men realise most of the time they did n't want to use condom and it wa blamed on the woman for `` getting pregnant '' the amount of teenage pregnancy in america is higher than the uk . america is 52/1000 teenager are still in high school pregnant age 16 year old when in england it 's 32/1000 teenager are still in high school pregnant age 15 to 16 year old . some people ca n't afford child because retail shopping market get profit for buggy , child clothing , nappy or diaper for american , cot , moss basket , baby milk and toy . the list can go on . there is enough people in america . in fact there is 329.5million people living in the usa . also , the amount of child abuse by parent that never wanted them in the first place . that is cruel thing to do to them and abortion can stop child abuse.there were 4.1 million report of child maltreatment in the united state involving 7.753billion people on the planet i think we are good . well , american are slowly shooting child and themselves to death with their gun law ."
well i do n't think most people care about anybody in this country
my am my sister have it
it 's all because of the people trump appointed to the court .
"this law that wa over turned allowed unborn baby of any age before birth to be ripped apart inside the womb with a pair of tongs in order to be removed , if you think this wa a good law youre dumb or evil , perhaps both . how about a baby right not to be ripped apart ?"
wow ! ! thankful but great news ! more opportunity
it wa never a right . where doe it say it a right to murder your child ? show me . it murder . theyll just have to go to an evil state to kill their kid now .
"( tw ) the problem now is that there will be a rise of woman ; self harming , committing suicide , going to dodgy backstreet abortion some people get an abortion if the baby is stillborn , you wouldnt want your body to go through all the change and pain to birth a corpse . it sickens me because this mean child will now have to birth child . if a woman wa r @ p3d , you think it ok for her to go through emotional and physical pain all because pro life you can survive 8 minute without a heart so featus having heart beat doesnt mean anything ."
abortion is murder . period .
"in a world which is already so substantially overpopulated , this u court judgement is utterly mad and irresponsible ."
stop having sex if you ca n't have child .
if these wonderful life of unborn baby can have the right and speak up for their life ? they will choose to abort their parent .
"none of u walking this earth at this moment if we had been aborted . are you not happy and grateful that you got have the gift of life ? it is possible to not have to face the choice a to whether to have an abortion or not , it is about making the choice to not risk getting pregnant by abstaining . abortion is murder ."
it called being responsible ..... to easy just to end a life ...... not quite the same but it like to easy to marry and divorce these day .
it is time for all republican and liberal ' to get read of your republican representative this is because you republican dint do your job and got read of your representative that are not doing what is best for but for them self 's when the time come show them what will happen if they go against the people wish your vote . will let those republican by daring the swamp .
"if youre not having unprotected sex you wont get pregnant ? all of this so woman can have their sugar wall busted in raw . abit irresponsible if you ask me . you get blasted in , why should you have the right from stopping a baby blasting outta you . they love to say woman are special because they can bring life . well apparently not . they all fighting for the right not too ? it like if you werent graped than it your responsibility to give birth to that child and raise it . you want to raise your leg but not your kid ? gummon land of the free"
boden his time to make money out of abortion by criminalising it ? ! after the pandemic and lockdown i guess million of horney american must be bonking like crazy . you wo n't see that in anally retentive uk ! !
"the attorney general of arkansas is a heartless cretin . the reason she can not imagine the pile of dead woman her decision will inevitably create is because abortion ha been safe and legal for 50 year . with the stroke of her pen , blood is on her hand ."
again i just dont see why supreme court decided this . it should be the people . no one have the right to take a life of an unborn life .
god bless the scotus & fjb ! ! !
thought and prayer for the pregnant men affected by this decision .
horrible country with a horrible political system . i will be forever grateful that i dont live there . my heart go out to all the american suffering in the land of the free .
praise be to our lord and saviour
"if aoc should accidentally get pregnant ( no one in their right mind would want to impregnate her ) , all of the united state should make an exception when it come to abortion , for the sake of our democracy , grant her the abortion that she request , with all expense paid , because this republic can not take the chance that her offspring will be just a mentally challenged a she is ! ! !"
congratulation usa on finally realizing abortion is not a right . give a flying fuck to filthy feminazis who are cry .
"the byproduct of left wing human waste is : dead unborn child , trans woman 's breast , and trans male penis . they are a strange breed ."
nice to see another totally misleading headline from the bbc
you are liar ! your title is a lie . abortion wa sent back to the state and the the people of each state .
"just make a law . no one is allowed to have child without a licence . requirement no welfare , no bipolar allowed , no mental person eather . you must make income and have a job . let see if these thing start chanting to for child now instead . or have a blue screen of death ."
"this world .... ! ! stumped at the need for more gun constraint but no issue banning the constitutional right for woman to choose to abort their baby ! woman are upset ( a they should be , ) but too many of you do n't factor in how reckless/unprotected sex ( for some , not all ) result in unwanted pregnancy ! yes , let 's fight for our right , but let 's also work on being more responsible with our body , which would decrease the number of baby terminated before birth ! !"
"this is just beginning . the next target will be gay right and birth control . the conservative wing is trying to fall back 50 year and if this absurdity of the supreme court continues , soon enough the united state will become once again , a white man nation . the democrat must win the senate election and put an end to this 21st century blasphemy ."
may god protect the fetus of the antichrist what is he waiting for now a soul ?
"this is so sad , those poor woman that will be forced to have a baby that they dont want , then what ? give the baby up for adoption or struggle to look after them and the child potentially ending up in foster care ? this is so messed up , what a step backwards for america ."
"we remind the chinese government do not to encourage the bombing of ukrainian railway ! do n't encourage russian war ! otherwise , we will no longer guarantee the safety of the the belt and road railway !"
another reason why the whole world is laughing at the u ...
"imagine being so desperate for sex , you 'll forgo all the many type of contraception , and pursue a few moment of pleasure at the expense of someone else 's life . sad person , sad world ."
"abortion is a woman 's right . however if a woman can terminate her pregnancy due to her financial situation , etc , , than a man should have the right to terminate his contract to pay child support if he ha poor financial standing . rather than taking away right , we should be giving equal right to both men and woman on this issue ."
this is disgusting
"life is life yes , why do human think they can control life , is it because we can terminate life ? who will ever understand what life is ?"
"congratulation usa ! welcome back to the civilized world ! the united state ha made progress in civilizing by changing legislation , and now you are one of the people . only primitive kill unborn child . thank god ! god is great ! glory jesus christ !"
the abortionist seem to have aborted themselves out of existence .
"stop getting drunk and handing out your pussy , be an adult and there is no need for abortion !"
"everybody want to `` save the child '' , but nobody want to raise them . if the entire country doe a 180 in le than a decade because of this , we need to pack the court . you ca n't changed 100 year of preconceived decision built ontop of other judgement in le than a decade ; you 're cheating the system ... at that point you 're forcing your perspective on other people and not looking back at past judgement , taking in multiple perspectives/judgements and deciding where to go from there ... that 's how the court have always worked ."
"the title is misleading , it did n't remove any right but gave them to the state , witch is the proper place . not a constitutional right . this is a state right issue ."
"if the law wa about men , woman would just say .... be more responsible ."
"all pro-abortion , just go to a doctor and do the thing , so you ca n't have kid in first place . what 's the matter ."
if you have no control of your body what is next ... chip implant ...
"noooooo the right to chose and the right of abortion is a human right and our right of freedom , we need to fight this rulling , this decision is not the final word , the people will speak up and fight for our freedom"
another thing they have blamed trump for ... why doe n't anyone see that this is all about negative coverage for trump - he wa high in the poll a biden is pathetic - all of this is to sabotage the next election .
"right to abortion ? dont make me laugh . what you mean is the right to murder an innocent child ha been abolished . one of the best day in the u . keep moving forward to progrssive ! there are many way to prevent accident pregnancy . sex isnt a necessity too . if you cant control your body and want to have an unsafe sex , then you deserve to raise an innocent child you 're creating . you are a human , not an animal . murdering an unborn child isnt a solution , it a selfish most barbaric sht one can do ."
i wish it happens to my country too
this channel is a circus
"interesting ... such government also should provide all essential to d child being born unplanned including good education and provide for family sufficient enough to meet all demand . besides , why is controlling over population not a kpi of controlling climate change . this should be not only about a right of a person to decide but also should be understood that controlling reproduction is a overall good thing for d society . u is becoming the land of crazy . strange and sad ."
yay yay yay . i love life and i love our constitutional right . such a tear filled happy day
it 's funny how suddenly the left is talking about `` woman '' again . i thought biological sex had nothing to do with giving birth ? i thought you were all supposed to say `` birthing people '' now ? what changed ?
good now they cant kill baby
`` jesus love the little childern '' how weird is that lolol . church people are funny
"this because 'communists ' said- enforce covid-19 vaccination status for work & travel . * the court wa just doing what wa asked , invade privacy !"
this is extremely bad decision from the supreme court . what will happen to all the woman who ca n't give birth to a child due to medical condition and risk to their life ? what happens to all the woman who are raped and ca n't bear the child due to trauma or just because so ? is this how the usa doe thing ? sad how the humanity and intellect of people just go backwards and woman are still object perceived by men without any right and choice ! sad
the irony in this is they seem to care so much about baby 's getting killed in abortion and yet they do n't give a shit about the child who died in school shooting this is nothing but hypocritical bullshit .
"abortion is wrong , all of you who support it is going to hell"
"so a stillborn baby is worth saving instead of a woman that could actually live ? it cruel to force a woman to care a already dead baby to full term , or a child a product of rape or incest , i do agree that people need to be more responsible when it come to having a child , but people deserve a choice not all pregnancy is consensual . this anti-abortion ruling is just gon na lead to an increase in heath problem , such a suicide and depression and kid ending up in foster care without a family , because there isnt enough child already there already ."
"my body my choice except for vaccine . if they are so terrified , close your leg and use contraception ."
that 's really disgusting that government did this to woman in the usa . all the woman are sister and i support girl who protest against this shit . abortion is the right of every woman . rise up abortion right ! love from russia
"where doe a british anchor of all people get off calling an originalist , faithful interpretation of the constitution , `` radical ? ''"
this will also solidify the fact in people mind that religion affect even the non-religious . religion divide and it hurt people . faith is a virus .
"i think if a woman get rped no abortion , but then i think the just the father and the father alone should be legally responsible for the baby a a counter option to life in prison"
freak -- on both side .
"looking at time index 1:30 , the entire world need to see exactly what sort of circus freak have been pushing for the destruction of right and freedom , in the u of a ."
"i dont understand how arguing that because kid life in the foster system are difficult , that somehow justifies killing them . if a child in foster care told you they wanted to commit suicide , would you stop them or let the go through with it ?"
"america 's corrupt and total evil filth , called the evangelicals , have metastasized their cancer with their takeover of america 's federal and state government . this will not end well . i the same week the scotus decided to make it perfectly legal for concealed carry , anyone who want to shoot someone just ha to say they felt like their life wa threatened . many are going to die for that decision and their same-breath overturning of r v w , woman will be dying . this is not about life -- this is about going back to an america that never existed . people like marjorie taylor greene is perfectly ok with the jan 6th insurrection because it wa `` patriotic american wanting to get rid of dictatorship ! '' well , people -- look who the real dictator are ."
you should hace shown the story of those whove chosen to safe the life of their baby - they are human too and their life have meaning
"usa will be full of basterds , congratulation : d ; we will call basterd usa"
# peopleofcolortriedtotellyou do not vote for trump . he wa able to nominate 3 supreme court justice that are going to destroy your life .
"i 'm pro choice myself . i do n't think abortion is a good or a bad thing , i think it 's a case by case basis thing . all i can say is i hope any state that make it illegal is willing to pour ample amount of money into the foster system to balance this .. which they wo n't ."
"abortion is the process of tearing a fetus , crushing it , and removing it from the body for disposal . is it a woman 's right ?"
"thats a lie ! ! ! the supreme court of the united state of america simply handed this back to the state , where it belongs ! youre reporting like sod . victory ! stop throwing your crack at anything that walk by ! ! !"
this is beyond weird and stupid . i mean how do these people ( against abortion ) function ? they fail at being a civilized human at the basic level .
"woman have the option of keeping the child , putting the child up for adoption , or going to a state where abortion is legal . the federal government should never have been involved ... just a the federal government is not involved in the life/death decision of captial punishment ... where each state set it own law ."
congratulation to all the unborn baby and to all the dad who want their kiddos !
"i dont understand what they fuss about if the government rule to no abortion . first woman or girl . keep your leg shut if your not ready to become a mother . focus on study , find a decent work instead of dating so young so casually . if you dont want to be responsible then stop having casual sex without protection . it is your body and thats true but it not the fault of innocent life to be kill because of your irresponsibility . the government should focus more on how to change this young generation to be more cautious , solve the drug issue and homelessness . some of this woman use drug , drink alcohol and do casual sex . killing is never right even how much you justify it by saying your young etc ."
"`` we are the only country in the world who ha freedom '' lol , you have the freedom to shoot yourselves , that 's what you have"
american are so backwards and laughable
if they hate men so much how could they ever get pregnant ! ! ! ! lololomao ! !
& ? why the walmart management kicked out the ukrainian immigrant by saying not to com back to walmart ? is there a food sale for american people only ? or is a shortage of food ? and why the american are telling ukrainian that the ukrainian people are buying all the food ? and because of the ukrainian the food and gas is so expensive ? do somebody care about immigrant ? or this is a trap with immigration ? the immigrant did not come to the united state to end up death we have enough problem in ukraine the united state do have money but they have more trap than money
by removing constitutional right to abortion u supreme court o on wrong side of liberty
what a bunch of fuckwitz and a bulshit president that ca n't do anything in his own country but very good at sending ukraine money for a war .
legal or illegal de still do so the killing
"we need to wake up ! america , you are becoming russia ! american people giving up their civil right for convenience and religious belief of other people ! they will be chipping away little by little from our freedom ! i wish everyone will see what is going on ! fight is on ! it is not about abortion ! this is about our democracy ! who will be next ? interracial marriage , gay right ? who will be singled out and destroyed ?"
"who stop comment from getting any more reply ? the quota is not exhausted . there are comment with way more reply than that , also i 'm trying to reply to someone who replied . not the commenter . whoever is doing this need to butt out !"
"coming from my perspective , a a woman who struggle with having child .. i agree with this law . however , this wa not always my viewpoint . since i understand what it is like to be assaulted , i wa always pro choice . that is until i found god and realized that he would want all of his child to be born no matter what . i deeply feel for all the victim of assault and i hope these people find god to help them through . on the other hand , i 've known woman who just wanted to go out , get drunk , not use any kind of protection and then wanted an abortion . that sickens me . i pray to be blessed with a child someday"
seriously ! ? i never thought this would happen in the u .
the next is to ban same-sex marriage in america
thank god for the consitution . all these woman need to be locked up in the nuthouse .
"simple ... you want abortion ? ... then you should also lose your womb too ... so that killing of a life in a womb be abolished too . and then you can have all that free and unprotected sex you want ! ! ! but ! ! ! in rape or health case , these are a different matter ."
yes ! pro-live won . great historical decision to maga .
"this is a great way to start changing the world , mow kid need to be disciplined for bad behavior and to have respect for others . i see a lot of change that need to happen . even what the teach at school and more important how parent are example to their child at home . this is very important adult need to better example on how to behave and have respect for others . this will start changing the world for the better"
63 million baby have been aborted since 1973 .

"1 corinthian 15:1 - moreover , brother , i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you , which also ye have received , and wherein ye stand ; 1 corinthian 15:2 - by which also ye are saved , if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you , unless ye have believed in vain . 1 corinthian 15:3 - for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received , how that christ died for our sin according to the scripture ; 1 corinthian 15:4 - and that he wa buried , and that he rose again the third day according to the scripture : john @ - for god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life . john 5:24 - verily , verily , i say unto you , he that heareth my word , and believeth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but is passed from death unto life . act 16:30 - and brought them out , and said , sir , what must i do to be saved ? act 16:31 - and they said , believe on the lord jesus christ , and thou shalt be saved , and thy house . hebrew 10:14 - for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified . ephesian @ - in whom ye also trusted , after that ye heard the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation : in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise , ephesian 4:30 - and grieve not the holy spirit of god , whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption . once saved always saved ."
"america is busy with it nose in russia affair while it own house is burning down . let see if woman will have strike , walkout and siitins to secure their right of choice ."
i wonder how quickly any of these woman will change their tune if they have an unwanted pregnancy .
one & only person can make life is the lord-god so he ha the final decision not you female . which mean it not your body it the lord-gods body you didnt make it he did .
look at all these twisted sick girl cry in the middle of the street because youre gon na force a young girl to have her incestuous father baby or the man who brutally raped her and took her innocence from her youre gon na force her to have that baby .. what about ectopic pregnancy ? when the child start forming in the woman fallopian tube and it going to rupture youre gon na let mother and baby die now ? maybe some of you should go to school to learn that sometimes abortion are needed to save the mother life . get a life you guy truly are weirdo . stay the fuck out of my vagina !

only people who never were in the situation to decide if they could or couldnt care for a child could make such a horrible decision .
it mean that baby life are no longer at the mercy of selfish woman !

why dont woman who want abortion adopt their baby to woman who have miscarriage or people who can not have child .. instead of being the excicutioner of these these poor innocent little soul ..
ahhh ... it feel gud 2b a american right now
"but it 's a you say it down to the individual state , so it ha not been banned nationwide . so why are the democrat trying to incite violence over this ? it can still happen so threatening to burn down the supreme court is very extreme in my view ! !"

"{ in the name of god the must merciful and compassionate } all woman 's in life ca n't do the abortion after the 40 day 's of pregnancy this wa in all holy book before the holy quran , they can remove the baby before the 40 day 's of pregnancy i swear in the name of great god it 's the true truth , but but if the woman respect it and she doe n't remove it from her body she will not regret at all especially the one who hurt so bad like the one who get raped from bad sick criminal from any year past or now because she a victim innocent woman and the great god respect them so much and if the woman raised the child she will take a great boon after life the great god will burn all the criminal in hell of fire after death , woman 's can do the abortion before the 40 day 's of pregnancy but she must go to a good professional doctor in hospital but she ca n't do the forbidden abortion after the 40 day 's of pregnancy because the great creator he put the soul in body of the child in his mother womb , about the bad sinrs woman 's who do the forbidden adultery she must stop and if she wa pregnant she must raised the baby or she give it to the government they will take care of him , if someone want something pls text me it 's my honor to help you. , yes i forgot something very important if the woman wa so ill and she bleeding she must go to hospital to remove the baby if that baby wad so dangerous to her live herself because sometimes woman 's fall off or she had some accident any accident in life or someone hurt her she must go to hospital immediately and it 's not matter if she wa pregnant before 40 day or not she must safe herself poor woman 's ca n't imagine how they feel when they be pregnant god bless all woman 's , if the woman wa not clean faithful she can remove the baby before the 40 day of pregnancy but she must stop and ask forgiveness i hope that ."
"abortion wa never protected under the constitution . that 's why roe v wade wa overturned . the supreme court did not take a stance on the legality of abortion , because there is no such law over which they have jurisdiction ; rather , they reached the only conclusion they * could * reach , which wa to affirm what is in the constitution , and that 's the 10th amendment , which make abortion a state issue ( which it is , given that healthcare is mentioned nowhere in the constitution ) . democrat have had 49 year since roe v wade to pas another amendment to enshrine abortion right , but instead they did nothing and therefore have only themselves to blame . but a usual , they point the finger at anyone & everything else for allegedly wronging them ."
all the one happy is un attractive and ugly
"an evil strategy of the wealthy and powerful to force the poor to reproduce enough cheap labour for them to continuously to exploit . the quality of their life , the health , both mentally and physically are not their concern . this is a tragedy not just to under privileged american woman , but to our entire human race ! this is a disgrace !"
"a woman should not be forcefully burdened with the child , this is truly a dark day in american history . this is wrong , they are treating woman like a secondary gender . these people of religion are taking life of woman , they think they are saving life of an unborn child , but the truth is they are pushing both the woman and child to hell of a life ahead"
i pray same-sex marriage get overturned a well . it 's an oxymoron for one and a total mockery of covenantal love god establishes between a man and a woman . rejoice in the lord !

if you believe in a god then you should automatically lose the right to be a judge : - you have already proved that you have no critical thinking skill .
"finally , good news ."
"bbc doe n't believe in god but they do support child abuse , remember who paid jimmy saville"

"10 of million of woman . wow thats a lot of woman who are killing child , time to move to a state that allows abortion if you 're a woman who sleep around yikes crazy woman everywhere ."
abortion is murder and the child doe n't have a say in it if people do n't want to have a child used contraceptive it 's a simple a that the bible say that god saw the embryo and all the working part of david alive and growing

the handmaid tale
a a male abortion ha to be legal idc what ppl say
"it burned my heart to watch video on social medium of woman who say that they killed their child , they had abortion . if the problem is with poverty , then this is not a justification for committing such a horrific crime . otherwise , what are we different from those who bury their daughter for fear of poverty 14 century ago ? note : all law and regulation allow abortion in case of rape and danger to the life of the mother . what we object to is abortion without a real reason , which is most of the case of abortion ."
people are stupid some lady said `` what about the dad that rape their daughter '' my answer 2 that is good now there will me evidence of what he 's doing instead of u having law that help these people destroy evidence and life ! !
"these people are selfish and delusional to think that they have the right to tell a woman what choice she make about their body and their own life . shame on u america , usually proud to be an american ... not today"
the abortion protester who hassle woman outside of clinic can eat shit and die !

"how d care if it illegal stil de kil unborn child , worse dan war"
and organised crime thanks the government for a brand new business adventure .
"if i were to debate a person on abortion there would be 3 thing ill point out . 1. the fetus ha value , just not a much a a person ( thatll be important leading to the third point and ill expand on that ) 2.the fetus is a human being in the sense it a being which come from someone , but it isnt a person . it not cognitively changing or reacting to anything that happens to it so from that standpoint it matter le and is complete indifference 3. the reason it good to draw the line at birth ( third trimester abortion rarely happpen and most of the time they do it for extreme medical reason ) is because of physical consequence . the woman ha something in herself which if held to the contrary of what i believe shed have to deal with the struggle of giving birth a someone who doesnt want to a well a the vast amount of possible health issue that come with giving birth outside of just when the baby is out . once a baby is born , there little to no physical consequence because the person can rid themselves of responsibility a they will and it outside themselves . the baby also isnt a person but it matter enough to have it live due to what it can accomplish mixed with that it isnt a physical hindering of someone with actual personhood a far a their body"
get your fact straight . the federal government turn the matter over to the individual state . there are only 5 state where abortion is illegal .
so if you got raped and pregnant ? your gon na take care of the child ?
there is no federal right to marry anyone ; people voted to define marriage in the last 15 yr and the ussc took away their right by overriding their democracy .
trump did that ; the man get thing done .
"are all foreign journalist this ignorant ? there is no constitutional right to an abortion , there never ha been . that wa the entire point of the sc ruling . even liberal legal scholar concede that roe wa founded in bad law . the supreme court doe not legislate policy . it only purpose is to interpret the constitution . i wa a journalism major before my professor told me that true journalism wa dead , and the first thing we learned is how to do proper research and fact check . please educate yourself ."
"a an australian , you may say i have no right to view my opinions- but i say screw that ! im lucky to live in a country where our government actually give a sh * t about u ! it sad how some of you american care more about your gun than woman ! here an idea , if these men/women that believe in a magical man in the sky think it okay to tell what woman should do with their body , how about you old f * cks get a vasectomy at age 60 ? and even better , men below 18 a well ? can you american woman please bring that up with the supreme court ? if they think taking away woman right is okay then theirs should be taken away too ! fair is fair right ? bloody pathetic ! i hope these law change for you beautiful american woman ! xxx"
this lie that most woman are getting abortion from abuse need to stop most woman are using abortion like birth control i know a woman who had 11 abortion before she had the last 4 child . this is sexual irresponsibility
"state cant regulate gun but woman 's right on abortion with no exception to incest or even r @ pe ? ? ok america , call urself a `` free country '' why dont ya"
woman fighting for the right to be sexually irresponsible .
"i do n't like christian but in this case they 're right , abortion is a murder and woman should not be able to kill child and face little consequence ."
"i thought biden can make that decision . poor american , , i rather have that option to choose ."
so people are upset because they ca n't end life anymore what ha this world come too ? ? ?
"it 's about the population to sustain status quo . black american are the most valuable economic resource for the white people power structure . it 's about the power of the ink pen to maintain the white people power structure . the goal of white supremacist ' [ law making ] court with weaponized abortion law is about sustaining a perpetual supply of black body for the number one job creator of white people -- the civil and criminal codification system . these two system do not work without people to intrap into 1 - if not both - to finance job creation and government funding ( s ) . black body are the number one resource to sustain both civil and criminal system for white people employment and power . it is also about increasing the white american population to protect the economic power of the white race forever into the future . the white american population is shrinking . to play the long-game , demand forwarded thinking of at least three generation - [ 100 yr ] from this minute . but first you got ta be around in a century - meaning descendant / baby to pas power & high income to .. the white labor force must be replenished a the older white labourer leave the labor market . the potential labor output of the unborn white child is extremely valuable to those in longstanding white position of power and high income . the longstanding position of white power and high income can not remain in the hand of white power or be conserved and sustained for white people only if the white labor force to retain and conserve the high income is not replenished . this is why dixiecrat republican with high income and position of power do not care about life after birth . because the high quality of life after birth is subject-to birth into an already established white family with benefit and security of longstanding white position of power and access to `` white power & privilege '' is determined by birth and/or the output value of mental and physical labor of the white person . it is `` white socialism '' disguised a `` capitalism '' which is based on false scarcity and false fear of black power . the official `` citizenship document '' or `` birth certificate '' issued by all predominate white country is the `` proof of collateral '' for the country of birth and based on the potential output of valuable asset , value development and job creation ( basically the country 's gdp ) white country are able to borrow high amount of money from international resource based on the potential cash flow & collateral produced from the labor of each citizen - especially each white citizen - whom can not be collateralized if abortion impedes white population or white birth certificate - hence death certificate and the withdrawal from the gold standard of dollar value . this is why in 1971 the usa eliminated the dollar gold standard and put the dollar up again the usa full faith and credit of the usa 's gross domestic product - which should now be the gross labor production instead . especially the income and job creation mechanism of the civil and criminal codification system - the two system typically allocated the largest percentage of city , county , state & federal operating budget - designed to extract income from the powerless and poor non-whites by way of fine , fee , judgement and conviction to finance white job creation throughout local , state & federal government by way of the covert marshall law style policing in the low income ( non-white ) community for the sole purpose of perpetuating poverty - and thereby gaslighting civil liability and criminal activity - a perpetual supply of civil liability and a pipeline of criminal for sustained white job creation . the civil and criminal codification system are the largest white people job creation mechanism in local , state & federal territory - the number one creator of all type of job position , income level and career . job & career reserved and passed down to white family & friend forever and ever . propagated to conserve and retain white power and position of high income . the true power first acquired thru gunpowder and protected today with the largest military and the most nuclear bomb . a position black people will be kept away from at all cost - even if the white people were not so afraid of such black position and power , they can not accept black people controlling the most powerful military with the most nuclear bomb - unless it 's over their dead body ."
i am loving in a giant cult run country . fuck .
the state will decide if they will allow abortion . the people of the state will decide and thats the way it should be .
third country
"land of the `` free '' = banning book , dresscode for child and now this . home of the `` brave `` = the kidd are more likly to get shoot then of cancer or drivning accident ."
"about time we fight against these narcissist that have no believe in god , morality or common sense . look like youre gon na have to be more careful when having sex . bohooo ! gtfo lol"
it 's hard to explain but this mean trump ha a stronger chance of election
"there will now always be a black market abortion will still be done , legally or not . hopefully safely , but this wa a lot of money and time wasted . abortion will still continue ! a few corporation have already put a change in their health plan , stating that they will provide financial help to get their employee to a safe state and care . and it all good for the higher ups that made this decision . until it their daughter that get pregnant because the family friend raped them or etc . pfffft , dont think they wont secretly find a safe way to treat their family ."
congratulation
"`` i 'm 21 and i 'm terrified ! '' of what ? seriously , of what ? you 're not in danger . the only thing you ca n't do now that you could before is murder a baby . except you still can in half the state . are you terrified that if you get pregnant , you might be required to give birth to the child ? okay , fine . giving birth , being pregnant , that 's all a very big deal , so it 's understandable to not want to go through that . if that 's the case , try not having sex . there 's a lot of talk about rape , incest , and pregnancy complication . aside from the fact that these case are a tiny minority of abortion , my opinion on those is a follows . 1 , rape : reallocate resource from abortion clinic to psychological counseling and maternity assistance . strongly encourage the victim to make the best of her situation , and help her through it . abortion may be a last resort in extreme case . 2 , genetic/physical/mental defect : i think that this category is justifiable a potential reason for abortion , especially in extreme case where the child 's quality of life would be severely impacted . ( eg , if an incurable disease would mean the child would be born and live a short life of suffering , it 's arguable that it would be more humane to end it a soon a possible ) 3 , incest : refer to part 1 and 2. incest may or may not be rape , and may or may not cause a deformity or defect . 4 , pregnancy complication : if complication arise and the mother 's life is threatened by the pregnancy , this is reasonable cause for an abortion procedure . there wa also talk of abortion being a human right . it 's not . it can not be . human right are inherent , not provided . you have no right to any service or resource whatsoever . you do not have the right to have an abortion , to have a life-saving medicine , to have access to the internet , or to have water . here 's why . if you have the right to , say , education , that mean that any government which upholds human right must guarantee that you have education . that mean they must not only build school , but they are responsible for making sure there are teacher . and if , hypothetically , you lived in a low population area and no teacher were around , the government would be required to relocate a teacher to that location , so you can have your rightful education . they would need to make it a legally binding statute that someone must educate you , and if that someone refuse to provide their service , they are in violation of the law . this make them a slave of the state : work or be punished . give water or be punished . educate or be punished . abort this pregnancy or be punished . freedom is a human right , because we all have it by default . actual right are thing that you start out with , that you have by default . they can only be restricted or infringed , they are not , can not be , something that someone doe for you , because that infringes other people 's right . life is a right . freedom is a right ."
congratulation
a return to subjugating woman and keeping them in poverty and misery .
"the woman with the sign in the thumbnail `` the future is anti-abortion '' .... what a clueless snapper . i ca n't believe there are woman who are against abortion and against a woman 's right to choose . seriously what a woman doe with her body and her life should be up to her not some republican loser . i 'm not american but republican are totally f 'd . this is just one reason why they are f 'd but there are soooo many more reason . leave the woman alone , let them decide for themselves ."
my : god ! ! the thought that a baby about to be delivered can no longer be subject to having a pair of forceps thrust into it skull and it brain sucked out is unconscionable ! ! ! we demand partial abortion ! ! ! ! !
abortion kill innocent human life and should be banned worldwide
imagine being saddened by not being allowed to murder human baby in the womb
some of yall in the comment raising hell because they said y'all ca n't kill y'all baby no more .. ca n't be the same people going to church praying to god for money .. i mean seriously
this reporter look amazing her suit is so neatly fitted on her . the woman in the blue .
if woman can opt out of being a parent then men should have the same right without being financially burdened for the next 20 year . men should n't be forced to pay for something woman ultimately can destroy .
"the pro-life movement is pro-death , and more people need to recognize this important fact . the same justice and politician who weep crocodile tear for embryo are the one who sentence thousand of the elderly and child to die . how pro-life are they really when they refuse to protect people from covid and gun ? the blood of thousand stain their hand , disproving their rhetoric about caring for life . we need to vocally label conservative a the pro-death party , and directly call out people like brett kavanaugh and clarence thomas a the heartless , treacherous wretch they truly are . dont let these hypocrite claim the higher ground on the cause of saving life ; challenge them and ask how many people died from their other action ."
why not use condom what is the need to get pregnant if tou dont want the child dont you know doing sex make baby
pro - life . woman should think life is a precious gift . jesus christ is bos . the world universe ha killed million trillion of unborn child . woman say it is their choice and their body . what about the child body . parent supposed to protect their unborn child not get rid of their tiny body . god help woman .
screaming they have the right to kill baby 's should strike a notch in every human being alive . it sound kind of sick doesnt it ! if most people had seen what the after shot of an abortion look like they wouldnt feel that way !
"thanks trump , for the march for life ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"

u is messed up
"psalm 139:13-18 ( tlb ) -13you made all the delicate , inner part of my body and knit them together in my mother womb.14thank you for making me so wonderfully complex ! it is amazing to think about . your workmanship is marvelousand how well i know it.15you were there while i wa being formed in utter seclusion ! 16you saw me before i wa born and scheduled each day of my life before i began to breathe . every day wa recorded in your book ! 17-18how precious it is , lord , to realize that you are thinking about me constantly ! i cant even count how many time a day your thought turn toward me . and when i waken in the morning , you are still thinking of me !"
"a a child whose parent considered abortion . it not right to force woman to have these baby . it suck knowing you were unwanted and that you ruined your parent life . one broken condom and they got me , a recalled birth control and they got my sister . to this day , my parent hate each other because of my mom 's decision to have u . they were happy newlywed but were definitely not ready for child , let alone two . sometimes i wish my mom just went through with it . i hate that i put this burden on them and it not like i would 've known . and that 's what these million of kid will feel like . my mom had an abortion at 15 when she wa raped by a mentor . she wa too young to be a mom . she ended up having another one 8 year after i wa born . another bc mistake but she found out she had cervical cancer around 2 month and had to choose getting chemo and losing the baby or waiting til the baby wa born and hoping it did n't spread and we lose her or both of them . she chose to stay with her living child . i mean we were sad at the loss but we wanted our mom more . abortion are n't always bad and each one should be treated individually instead of outlawing all of it ."
"can you imagine the increase of foster care that these unwanted birth will go into . most teenager having child , do n't have the mean to provide for a child , whether it is financially or mentally . child may suffer if in fact these child never get adopted and go thru the foster care route . will the government then help with the surge of child in a foster care situation ?"
protester should educate themselves on how to prevent a pregnancy and stop killing defenseless human being . life begin in the womb and that life matter and should be protected .
praise god for life.god alone ha the right to terminate life . these woman that are fighting are deeply disturbed they have unclean spirit . jesus is king and every knee will bow either a guilty sinner needing forgiveness . or a sinner being judged.all these woman are upset u know how these precious woman can avoid being all these problem fear god do n't have sex outside of marriage . jesus is prolfe he died so you can have eternal life .. be born again trust jesus a your savior from your sin
so much for land of freedom and opportunity ! it is a v cruel and impractical ban . what if you know your child will be born crippled or stunted and cant help yourselves if you decide not to proceed with pregnancy ? !
it 's a slaughter house .... these people are demon driven ! !
it 's evil to murder an unborn precious living human created by god not man 's decision .... hanges are good lord god say all good thing come from above
"no accountability , they want the right to be irresponsible with their body . while men have none"

well i imagine this will cause an increase use of condom and a drop in std case at least .
"funny , the same people who are screaming my body my choice are the same people who support vaccine mandate . the same democrat who call everyone who doe not support them racist are calling justice thomas uncle tom . the same democrat who want to pack the court are the same people who were outraged when trump got to pick a few judge . once again , democrat live by the belief that anything is ok a long a it fit their agenda . democrat are the party of race baiting , hate and division . keep everyone dependent , divided and scared so they can be controlled ."
"good bye usa ! did the taliban just take over ? disgusting , disturbing , disbelief ! i will never visit this country again ."
"reading the comment below , i am reminded of why leftist elite call you brainwashed moron `` useful idiot '' . the supreme court did not take away your right to kill unborn baby . it simply upheld the 10th amendment , which make clear that such decision are the purview of the individual state , not of the federal government . some state will outlaw feticide , a is their right , and others will keep it ."
reversing roe is a big win for pedophile priest and the religious fascist that worship them .
they need to make abortion ilegal . death penalty for abortion .
biden look like he 's gon na pas out just reading his script . dude is just not interested lol
"dr willy wo n't be crushing anymore baby '' skull in arkansas . sorry , not sorry ."
"baby killer biden ca n't get baby formula to mother , but he 's doing everything to get them their pill to kill their baby in their womb ."
for 50 year usa wa in lockstep with north korea and china with abortion . now we can get back to walking a moral path .
"i have been to court many time . when the judge asked me if , i plea guilty or not : . , the thought always went through my mind : 'could you have avoided this ' 'could you have made better decision ' . `` could you have listened to your father and mother not to go out on a saturday night'. ? ! / .. i understood i made lot of wrong choice at that age . i always plead guilty . i knew that taking responsibility for my own action meant being accountable . today , these folk seem to forget who is responsible . they are !"
"lady , do n't let your body cheaper than a prositute"
supreme court is pro life until it come to school shooting ? strange .
"abortion is killing , no to abortion"
abortion is genocide ....
i 'm so happy with the court ruling no more genocide against baby . abortion is genocide .
the only good thing about 2022
"men need to shut their mouth . an unwanted baby doesnt ruin their livesonly woman life . so now foster care and orphanage will skyrocket in population . many more kid will be without parent . well have 12 year old giving birth . raped woman will be forced to carry . poverty for woman will increase greatly . i think the `` father '' and fetus should get dna test and be forced to pay child support upon conceiving not birth . also , pay half the hospital and doctor bill . prison if they dont ! they already dont with no consequence . so we are putting woman right back at that severe disadvantage and woman salary will decrease and well see fewer in management position because of sickness , delivery and maternity leave . of course men want this . it give them the upper hand . forcing woman to have a baby they dont want will never turn out well . imagine the self abortion and desperate measure woman will take . many will have the procedure in mexico . this will traumatize million . i think a long a a fetus cant live on it own outside the womb , abortion should be legal . government better not touch the plan b pill , change birth control , no question asked rule . in fact now we need more of this readily available and free at planned parenthood . federal law like this worry the sh/te outa me . each state should govern itself not nine people ! i know my state will ban it but i still believe in state governance . we can not let this seep into other area where we end up being run federally . we arent china , russia or north korea . i guarantee those six vote were to lord over the state not to care about fetus . they know good and well this will financially cost u dearly . it probably also ha something to do with an increase in natural born american citizen becoming more and more of the majority . taking away woman right is unjust and discriminatory . im so sick of the inequality . weve never even had a female president . never . black life matter ? yes and weve even had a black president . a man . i still get teary eyed thinking about at least we have a madam vice president . but i want to see a madam president and first gentleman of the white house . and all of those people standing out there cry in happinessare they going to adopt thes unwanted baby . will they volunteer their time at an orphanage ? will they foster ten kid ? of course not because theyre hypocrite . so yeahthere are so many horrible thing about this ."
hm well the same sex marriage is next . one thing to say to the judge .... how about interatrial marriage judge ? oh sorry you are married to a white woman hm .... well if you open pandora 's box you never know the outcome ....
it 's scary to see these woman celebrating ... abortion ca n't be stopped ... woman will continue to terminate unwanted pregnancy by all mean possible and most likely now die doing it !
"u guy remember the film hot tub time machine ? specifically , the scene of chose it dose it . so , if the believe the baby should be born , they should be handled the right to rise those kid . the mother 's do n't want to kid ( this varies ) . all those people who do n't want abortion law should be handed the kid born . the kid which the mother doe not want for which ever reason . we all win ."
... i 'm ready to get the out of this country ...
america gone a bit crazy lately ha n't it
"if anything america need to stop having child ... the thought pro here must have been extremely short . poverty will rise , clearly ! lower educated family 's will grow causing more mental health issue . but at least you still have gun law to support bad mental health in child . the movie idiosyncrasy wa supposed to be a joke ."
lol so much not correct with this reporting . there is no `` legal obligation '' to ban abortion . nonsense . all the ruling doe is follow the constitution and give state some of their right back against the federal government . the state will now get to decide for themselves a they always had the right to do so .
`` who is the government to decide what i do with my body '' who are you to decide what happens to the baby body ?
trump is a trump indeed
pro-life doe not end with delivery of the baby
what 's next america ? chastity belt ?
it should be illegal for woman to say no to men . saying no is the murdering of a potential baby ! murder is murder !
guy saying abortion is murder on 5:15 can burn in hell for all i care because it not murder .
banning abortion is wrong and it a woman choice . some people make excuse saying it murder and should be banned if people dont like it then leave it alone and they need to just stay of it it none of they business .
"god is watching over his gift of life taken for granted by human . contraceptive are widely available , they are not banned . for rape and incest case , the individual will have to make a personal decision . some pro abortion activist say , it is their body . no one say it is n't . killing a baby/embryo is still murder . it should never be used a a substitute for contraceptive . there are long term implant contraceptive available and other state still available to perform abortion if someone see nothing wrong with ending a human life on an ongoing , a needed or regular basis ."
they should have the right to tell people what to do with their body if they 're using it a a baby killing weapon . what if i 'm an expert in karate ? they should n't be telling me that i do n't have the right to chop your neck and make you dead right ? yes they should ! there are a lot of different way that the body can be used a a weapon !
it interesting to see the clear bias of the reporter .
"yeah these abortion woman have dream they that they believe were destroyed , but destroying the dream of a prospective father who want child is just a bad ! i have child , and i pray every day that no idiot aborted my child . that 's sick shit ! i once married a girl in order to prevent her from getting an abortion ."
"rapist pedophile ' toxic family and relative must be very happy now they can able to control woman again . congratulation america . you are just a bad a other third world country . un-educated . narrow mind , control freak . nobody ha right to tell what woman want to their body ! ! you can not even help all of the orphan so why putting your nose on woman 's decision ? what about mandatory all of the guy to do vasectomy so it 's fair ? then we do not need to worry about getting pregnant . i would rather not to forgive all the parent who decided to keep the baby and ended up neglected or killed them . where are all your support for the parent who need help if you are pro-life ? ! if you think woman who did abortion are selfish then pro-life are selfish too because you judge another human being without thinking about their situation . we all not perfect but do not act like you better pro-life people ! ! ! america ha more problem than this ! ! ! !"
"mortal man can change law left or right , liberal or conservative but god 's law remain the same. `` thou shalt not kill '' ."
baby : `` it 's so good ! it 's so fine ! the right to life ha returned back to being mine ! '' praise the lord !
america coat hanger sale have gone through the roof
so woman are now upset they lost their right or choice .... men have no say either way and should have right to financial abortion ... only fair right . now you know how men feel .... how 's it feel lady ... suxs doe n't it
delicious liberal tear .
"hey woman out their who want to murder baby , get some contraception or keep your panty on . murder should never have been an option ."
"no matter how you rub your lip with your mouth , abortion is wrong , period ."
boycott american conservative owned company and business . they supported this .
"i get tired of doing this but here we go again . there is no constitutional right to abortion , nor wa there ever . biden and his leftist advisor may say there wa , but if you go look for yourself , you will see they are in serious error and misleading the public . the constitution actually give the state the right to legalize abortion . it doe n't even give that right to the supreme court . so when scotus decided on roe v wade they were acting a an unelected legislative body and acted in contradiction to the constitution . even rbg recognized this and said the decision wa on shaky ground and she wa pro abortion . this supreme court now is recognizing this and ha handed the state back their right . look , if you want your right and freedom that are enshrined in law , then you have to follow the law . you ca n't pick and choose which law you are going to follow . if you want to change the law then you need to pressure those who can do that . one thing i do know is that whenever the left doe n't get their way they react violently . remember the george floyd riot ? how about the threat and plot to kill supreme court justice ? i thought only right wing fascist did that sort of thing . guess not . seems the left is much more inclined to violence . i 've even watched certain member of congress and the now vice-president of the united state encouraging and cheering on that violence . think that might be sedition ?"
land of the free !
the u is becoming the anus of the world
abortion is not something a mother think lightly of . she probably thought it through and pulled herself together to go through the process . i feel sorry for every woman who arent in a state that will protect our right and will have to travel to another state for resource and service . there are many unwanted child in the system who struggle to find family because family also have their own standard on the child ( ren ) they want to adopt .
care about people .. care about woman .. really what about the care of the unborn baby selling the part afterwards on the open market .. care of the woman really take care of yourself before sex not afterwards ! ! ! !
`` the termination '' or the dismembering/killing you should say ?
we do have constitutional right and civil right in our country in our community our city our street abortion right it our body so is weed and drug it legal isnt it we do have our civil right also against marijuana
woman take care of yourselves before sex not afterwards murder is not the answer ! ! ! !
lady abortion is not in the constitution do ur research before you talk ! ! !
"abortion is irresponsible sex , and self-satisfaction . unless you are a victim of a crime ."
"biden , is not the `` majority '' , is half and half ! so it is even ..."
"what are scared about , stop sleeping around"
all i can say is i 'm glad joe is giving them someway out when they need it for certain circumstance
these ho want to screw around without using a condom and get an abortion when they fk up and get pregnant lol
abortion is banned : -eastern european : our child deserve to live ! god bless ! -westerners : anarchy
"oy , bruv , innit ... the extent of word i care to hear from brit ."
vomiting . this is horrible
bbc fake news ! it mean that people should go to state that agree with their value to kill baby
"i mean abortion is a choice , and it is upto the woman who is carrying the baby what she should or should n't do . in no way she should be compelled to carry the child if chooses not to . very sadge ."
"those of you who do n't live here in the u.s. please take to the street and protest for u . maybe if other country join u it will help . i 'm frieghten for my child and the world over with these extremist changing america in the worst way and having the largest military , the furture could be a very frightening place for all of u . we 're being oppressed . please help u ."
"abortion is murder . you get an abortion by a doctor . they 're the murderer and the woman is an accessory to murder . if there wa no option for woman , not to get pregnant . i could understand . but there 's many option to prevent getting pregnant . and a far a wanting to get pregnant , getting pregnant . but finding out the baby ha health issue . be a human being and give that baby a chance at life . and my view are n't about religion . it 's just about being a caring , sensitive human being . if a woman get raped . you can put that baby up for adoption . there 's so many couple who want baby , but ca n't . couple can give that baby a home . with lot of love and care for many year ."
"wether or not you are for abortion , notice the rise of church in the u , back to the middle age"
"slippery slope ... so what 's next beyond the current issue ? should we take away voting right from woman and people of color ? should only one religion be allowed ? should all people with disease and disability be removed from existence ? yes , it 's all the same thing and yes , this is normal in some backward country right now : ) democracy is great but not for everything . we have seen where democracy doe not work for certain issue . sometimes , you have to scrap democracy and support something because it 's just what a society of equality and respect is all about . i 'm glad that company are getting involved because they have right too and often power . it 's funny how big progressive company are the one with the courage - i would love to see big conservative company come out supporting pro-life , but you know they wo n't because at the end of the day , this would still hurt conservative party a lot more than progressive company . that speaks volume a to where the general society sits and what brand is more powerful . again , we 'll see how pro-choice company like netflix , disney , and amazon will be impacted - i do n't think much because most pro-lifer are hypocrite and will still visit disney , subscribe to netflix , and buy from amazon lol"
"so many child in state who go through foster care , child abuse and youth drug abuse . now there will be many more due to unwanted child birth . i ca n't believe it doe n't even make exception for rape and abuse victim . this is stupid , leaving mother accountable while father will fly off ( talking about those who abandon woman after pregnancy ) ."
"all the anti abortion chick are so ugly , so it doe n't matter to them , no one getting them pregnant ."
"hey everyone ... divide and rule strike again , their still playing u ."
"you would think the u would of learned from history , nationwide prohibition and the drug on war campaign where became illegal and how well that turned out .. i think the u government is a bipolar rollercoaster"
"it crazy how people want to have pleasure but do not want the responsibility that come with it . for every action there 's a reaction . the whole reason human have sex is to procreate and it engrained in the biology of every living thing . do not reply to me about rape and incest ( which contributes for 1.5 % abortion . a majority of woman who have abortion are doing it our of their own convenience to shy away from the responsiblity of having a child ) , or clump of cell ( which we all are ) , consciousness ( which in technicality from the viewpoint of pro-choicers would mean people in coma or asleep arent human being since they arent conscious ) , woman have the right to choose ( which everyone ha the right to choose but that doe not mean the choice is right and some choice should be prohibited e.g just because i have the choice to stab some one doe n't mean i will because a i stated earlier there 's consequence for each choice we make whether it immediate or in the future ) , you have control of your own body ( which in this case the body in dispute is not the mother and the child is the one going to be destroyed so it our duty a pro-lifer to defend it ) , woman may die from pregrancies ( with our advancement in technology the only 2 our of 100000 woman die from pregnacies which is a mortality rate of 0.0002 % and thats for woman with complicated health issue the average woman wont have any problem ) our argument hinge on the comparision between human inside and outside of the womb and our contention is there isnt any difference aside from their physical location so to say that people who are pro-life dont care about a child well-being when it outside the womb is b"
whats the lgbt doing about this why are they the most hit and vocal about this ? isnt girl to girl or male to male cant conceive ? can someone explain ? thanks .
"it doe n't matter , if you know the usconstitution . article 4section 2 , state clearly `` the citizen of each state shall be entitled to all the privilege and immunity of citizen in the several state . '' we have equal right .. state ca n't make anything illegal that is legal in , `` the several state `` . `` several '' mean 3 or more ."
third world country.in certain aspect .
shame on all of those involved in making this extremely harmful decision . for the so called `` land of the free '' this quite frankly a disgrace .
"should n't get pregnant in the first place . only reason for abortion is if the woman wa raped , or if the baby will be so badly deformed the quality of life is heartbreaking ."
"it a shame to see those woman cheering , for what ? ? ? why do they care so much what other woman and people with uterus do with their body , why doe it affect them ? ? go touch some grass"
million of innocent life will be saved . no one should have the right to murder child . 50 year of darkness in the usa have ended .
"ah yes , do n't trust woman to decide for themselves whether they want to or are ready to undergo the extremely difficult period of pregnancy , childbirth , and take care of a child . treat her like she 's not an adult and take the decision off her hand . then pretend you 're doing god 's work , but not actually care about the kid once it 's born ."
many people are not having child until late 20 early 30 . so i have a conspiracy theory that another small reason is to get more people in the workforce to compete against china 's superior work productivity .
finally joseph biden the 8 is taking drastic measure to increase the population a he should . time to return to our traditional root .
these protester believe that the supreme court actually make the law .. when in fact it your own state make the law .. now woman you have to take responsibility of your own fk up when out there drinking an fkn one night stand dude ...
it wa never a constitutional right to abort a baby . what you are saying is not true
"in america i do n't see any difference between lawful sexy life and rape.what doe abortion mean for such society ? because who will determine weather the case is related to rape or consent ? anyway abortion is equal to kill unborn kid intentionally , during the intercourse the dependant partner must be reverse a little bit when the agg is broken to avoid abortion ."
"i hate to break it to all of you , who are going on about baby and child , but : we 're not talking about baby . over 90 % of abortion take place before consciousness , awareness , ability to feel or experience anything , ha developed in the fetus . they 're a collection of developing cell that have the potential to become baby , but they 're not baby . i suspect those among you who oppose abortion on religious ( or what you think of a `` moral '' ) ground , do so because you believe in an immortal soul , and therefore they are people from the moment of conception . this is a belief , not a fact . it 's not `` moral '' to condemn others to a life of misery and poverty , simply to appease your own unsubstantiated belief . ( and incidentally , to all those crowing `` if you do n't want a baby , do n't get pregnant ... simple '' : 51 % of abortion in the u are ( or were ) provided to people who had been using contraception when they became pregnant ) . you all need to realise how simplistic and ill-informed are the opinion by which you deem yourself fit to pas judgement and sentence on others . look at your own bible , and `` judge not , that ye be not judged '' , and look for the beam in your own eye ... but i guess you only pay heed to the word of your supposed saviour , when they fit your own preconception and prejudice . you 're all quite sickening ."
"this is fear mongering at it best . abortion ha not been criminalized by the supreme court ! the supreme court reversed a wrong decision that wa taken 50 year ago which wa based on a flawed interpretation of the constitution thereby federalizing abortion . what it ha now done is to place the decision to legalize or ban abortion where it rightfully belongs -- in the hand of each state 's own legislature . and you already see the result of that decision -- progressive state will legalize abortion and everything will carry on a if nothing ha happened . more conservative state will ban abortion , but at this stage there is nothing that prohibits a woman who seek an abortion to travel to a neighboring state and have her abortion ."
in god you trust but your killing your own flesh !
march for life dont kill the innocent baby !
maybe it 's time for eu and uk and others to offer u woman the right to seek political asylum in country with abortion right ... at least that would send a message to penny and other fundamentalist .
"well america , you 're gon na have to introduce id check for woman crossing state line ."
hooray for all the troglodyte incest abomination baby who will now be born into a tortured life ! there are worse thing than not being born . who the f would want to come here anyway ! ?

"you can fool all of the time some of the time , some of the people all of the time , but never all of the people all of the time - abraham lincoln , please stop worshipping henry kissinger who is hosting the next bilderberg meeting when trickle down failed , then we can honestly debate this very divisive issue a adult"
search up cern july5th it not good
"`` pro life '' idjits fail to see the larger picture where ultimately this will make woman 2nd grade citizen . who from whatever background now ha to think twice about having any sexual autonomy . a man during a one night stand would do the deed and go away but the woman will have to spend the night hoping the protection did n't fail . so many other way where the law accommodates the man but never the woman . just because woman have the ability to birth doe n't mean it 's a duty , it 's not a miracle process . that 's how civilisation evolves . from a necessity to eventual enlightenment of choice . god made all human capable of that . there 's absolutely no logic , reason or emotion in this decision . it 's a farce and woman have to deal with it ."
"the land of freedom , huh ?"
the rest of the world should follow this example !
"commercial sex zone have developed around u.s. base worldwide . many look much the same , filled with liquor store , fast-food outlet , tattoo parlor , bar and club , and prostitution in one form or another . the evidence is just outside the gate in place such a baumholder and kaiserslautern in germany , and kadena and kin town on okinawa . even during the u.s. war in afghanistan and iraq , there have been multiple report of brothel and sex trafficking involving u.s. troop and contractor ."
seeing the leftist in anguish ... brings u great joy
the democrat 's and their supporter are going hard on this because of the midterm coming up ... anyone who know anything about how america 's political system work know that all that is needed is congress to wright a bill ( which thay have already ) and pas it into law ... nothing to see here folk ...
"why abortion , why not wearing condom in right way .. and have birth pill ... why killing baby ? ... so cruel .... have sex with responsibility .. not for fun .... all unborn baby killer will go to hell ... and thats their place forever ..."
so raped child in the usa will have to give birth from now on ? or theyll have to have an abortion in underground hospital ?
"also , i understand these particular situation that you all here are talking about here and respect it , but god decides about it , not u , who life and who dy . he is the righteous judge . amen ."
yep a civilization doe not kill it 's child no matter the circumstance you take the baby right to life from him .
"alleluia ! it 's about time america did something right . remember one thing , it is n't that someone ha the last word between group , it is that god , our creator , ha the last word . period . praise be to god ! glory to god forever ! amen ."
for those who disregard history are doomed to repeat it . the following is a rewording of first they came by pastor martin niemoller . first they came for woman 's right and i did not speak out because i wa not a woman . then they came for same sex marriage and intimacy . and i did not speak out because i wa in a hetrosexual marriage . then they came for interracial marriage and i did not speak out because i wa not a person of colour . then they came for the poor and i did not speak out because i wa not poor . then they came for me and there wa no one left to speak out for me . your right are a temporary set of privilege given to you by the government . if they are given then they can be taken away . what is happening in the usa is a direct attack on everyone . register to vote and ensure your voice is heard .
"hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah , thank you president trump for appointing justice to the supreme court"
tragic history is just happened ..
it 's up to the state to decide ... it 's not banned in the whole usa ... i do n't see a problem with that
welcome to the theocracy of america ( circa 1406 a.d . )

"1 ) contraception doe not give 100 % protection from getting pregnant . 2 ) a i see it , there will be le sex after such `` law '' . 3 ) the number of lesbian will grow , because it is impossible to get pregnant this way . 4 ) the rate of suicide among young pregnant woman will grow , specially among teenager . 5 ) abortion still will be done by those who need it , same a when alcohol or smoking is forbidden , but it will lead to high maternal mortality and complication ( because not done in official medical center ) . 6 ) now read carefully : they have banned any abortion ( even pill ! ) in many state already , including for the underage victim of rape and incest ! ! ! ! ! 7 ) number of baby left in orphanage will grow , amount of homeless/criminals too - because if kid were not wanted and parent left them , who will educate and give love/attention to +900.000 baby per year ? who will feed them , give clothes and teach ? 8 ) they say that this decision protects life , but they refused to pas the law about free contraception or baby food ! ! !"
"`` thousand of people want to have a right to kill people since they are not yet born '' , is it ?"
"your headline is incorrect . there wa never a constitutional right to an abortion . a quick word search through the u constitution will quickly show this . roe v. wade used a rather tenuous interpretation of an imputed right to privacy and even more tenuous interpretation of the right to due process in the original ruling . the only reason that it ha stood since 1973 is that there have been no scotus challenge which directly addressed roe v. wade . there have been case which addressed the application of the ruling , but none which addressed the validity of the ruling itself . do some research and you will find that even the pro-choice side admitted this in 1973. there have been many million of dollar spent to ensure that nothing with the required wording to challenge the original decision never saw the inside of a u district court , much le scotus ."
same sex marriage should also be abolished
seriously ? if woman die it their risk that they took why not make it safer by legalizing it ? wth is wrong with you guy

"if woman are so damn mad about my body , my choice , then why are you not mad when a man transition to a woman ? who will never understand what being a woman is , never having menstrual cycle , never giving birth , never growing breast . you will never be a woman if youre born a man . you will never be a man if youre born a woman . say anything you want lol , but youll always be what you were made to be . confusing ."
"how tf ha it effected your community negatively ? ? so youd rather have neglected , abused , abandoned , traumatized , and fucked up youth ? ? ? my lawd , im someone who see both side . woman have that right , to a point . i knew a woman who had 8 abortion before she had her child . didnt care about birth control , or any sort of preventing pregnancy . thats wrong . period . however , other circumstance i can totally understand . so now well be caring for all these kid , or their family will . and there will be an even bigger strain on government assistance with unwanted baby . are all these pro lifer going to help ? ? ? are they going to fund and raise these child ? will they help when they need counseling , and housing and food ? ? ? hell no they wont , were struggling a it is . cpa in most area are a joke . they cant deal with the high volume they have now , what will the future be like ? this is supposed to be the land of the free , but it the land of the how much money you have will gain you the power and voice insanity . solidifies and international move in my mind"
"abortion is killing and woman should do abortion just if they have good reason ( health issue , in case of rape ) . who are we to decide whether someone should live or no ! ? the fact that we own our body doe n't give u right to decide about someone 's life . if we are already pregnant then we should take responsibility for our action !"
the right to have an abortion ha never been guaranteed by the u.s. constitution . please read the u.s. supreme court justice 's decision . abortion have been given back to the voter in each state .
abortion is not in the constitution .
i ca n't wait to hear someone say how this will severely affect transgender woman .
"no sex with men ( husband , boyfriend or that app ) they say till the recent ruling overturned . woman will use it a a weapon against non favorable husband or boyfriend while going out to have sex with another man ; they will all relay on the natural calendar . men be on the watch ; our slit are becoming very tricky ! men be on the watch !"
you all better cut the christian crap about unborn baby . you cant force anyone into giving birth and carrying an unwanted child . end of story . my body my choice so you shut up
it is wrong to kill your child what 's wrong with you ?
"woman 's body , woman 's right but after we have a heartbeat then it 's murder !"
what ever happened to good old birth control ? why are people so freaked out that woman have to pay for their abortion now ? also it is paid if there is danger to the mother . why are the news not discussing both side of this subject matter .
"abortion is illegal in majority of country around the world , execept where the mother life is threatened"
woman stop showing your daughter to be like you acting like a w * * * * getting pregnant by everybody and then one in abortion . burn your tube burn your inside so you do n't get pregnant show your little girl to burn their inside they 're too so they do n't get pregnant that way i do n't have to be protesting stop sleeping with everybody inbreds
america is nothing more than one giant used car lot . ~vet
so usa is a religious government ? sharia law type shit but christian ?
i can not believe this ... the fact that the majority of politician 's are backed my religious group and funded by religious background for pr is discusting . crazy religious loser .
my body my choice . that is why no vaccine mandate
yes .... usa is going islamic .. ! ! a step back for woman 's right now same sex marriage and contraceptive are in consideration for future ruling .
this abortion crap ha nothing to do with woman right it just again who got the bigger democrat or republican
violence of abortion ? white privilege ? what about woman who are raped ? what about accident ?
wtf ha someone else 's organ have to do with that lady ? ridiculous .
all i 'm saying is the cost to raise child in 2022 is absurd . if developed country want to ban abortion they should at least make policy to make it easier to raise child for example making a social benefit program where daycare is free so the parent can just work and earn money to support their family .
`` i 've seen the devastation abortion ha brought on our country '' ? what is she talking about i would like to know what devastation she 's seen
"hard to tell the difference now between the taliban and america . neither belief in woman 's right . the adoption industry is lacking fresh stock to broker . adoption wa once a billion dollar industry that plotted to make this comeback . day care will be targeted next to ensure american woman are forced to stay home to care for child they did n't plan for and ca n't afford , or forced to relinquish their new born to the adoption broker ."
the u supreme court did not strike down abortion . it did however give each state the ability to decide ( by the people who live in those state ) to vote for whether or not you can have an abortion in that state . many company have said that if a woman would like to get an abortion and the state doe not allow that they would provide access and pay to help the woman get an abortion . your headline suck - stop it
this is not true . false flag .
`` right to kill baby '' that 's you are asking ? ? ? ? use always condom plz . save the baby ! simple ...
capitol punishment is murder yet that 's alright ... what i and i jah admire about the gop and maga is their consistency in heretical blasphemous hypocrisy . go trump ? tucson arizona sonoran desert jah sister jah rastafari praise tucson arizona sonoran desert

"for the upcoming fourth of july in the ( which includes any and all of his state and territory ) , i any and all detonation of firework need to be postponed ."
america the country where gun have officially more right than woman . what a shame .
thanks god ! ! this murdering act is finally ending . a win for life .
this title from the bbc is nothing more than a deceptive lie ! you still have the right to murder your child in the u . what the judge merely stated is the same thing that ruth b ginsburg stated in her own writing and that wa that the federal government ha no right to dictate and that each state individually can vote on what is allowed and want is n't allowed . read the blasted and complete decision written by the judge . bbc is full of crap !
"once a fetus is formed , to terminate it is murder , except in immediate health case . if woman do not want to be pregnant there are condom ."
"what there saying is legal abortion are no longer available legally , but illegal abortion will be on the rise . no doubt this will lead to the death of the child a well a the possible death of the mother . is there is no excuse , abortion should be legal with in the first 2 1/2 month . right now you have abortion group celebrating , yet they do not know the horror of what is to come with old style coat hanger abortion . it is sad that a 13-year-old girl raped by their father should be forced to carry a child and take away any possibility of college or any advanced school . i can honestly say that guy we see a rise in unexpected infant deathse because of this ."
"like i said in my video that i uploaded yesterday , we need new people in the government that werent born during world war 2 because obviously they still think were in the 60 and 70"
"abortion wa form by kkk and to control black population . per the liberal standard , whoever support abortion are racism"
the only choice woman should have is if my sandwich they make is on either wheat or rye .
"woman are being treated like zoo animal or cattle . it is certain that if this corrupt money making approach to banning abortion will cause the usa to suffer a raise of ramped poor mental health for the woman who are forced to bare unwanted child and the child who will suffer the shame of being unwanted and or foster care and what come with it . this act on the part of the supreme court need to be walked backed now before this mess get started . america is in shock a it is . we dont need another mass issue like roe v wade being overturned . if you look closer nothing really good came out of donald trump administration . and , l if anyone is thinking about the irs check trump allowed i am not for sure but believe the fine print for some if not all stated the money had to be paid back . loophole and fine print . read it . trust in government is out the door ."
i predict a fracturing of the united state into two country : 1 will be a neo-conservative country and 1 will be a social democracy
"there wa never a constitutional right to abortion in the u , and the scotus decision only return the question to the state where it should have always resided based on the 10th amendment ."
are the pro-lifer carrying gun ? religious fundamentalist fanatic are usually armed and willing to kill others . france is in the process of making abortion a right in their constitution . france is a laic state and refuse the control of religious fundamentalism interfering with people 's freedom of choice and human right .
"utter madness . such a backwards decision . bearing in mind this decision ha been made in a country like the u , which is meant to be at the forefront of advancement , it just scary ."
we truly are progressing backwards .
"this entire thing seems surreal . i am starting to wonder if `` state right '' went too far compared to having a consistent `` law of the land '' ? will different illegal abortion state make it a crime for a woman to leave their state and travel to another state to have an abortion ? if some state can shorten the trimester time for abortion , can other state lengthen the trimester time ?"
so the supreme court just announced it should no longer exist since it ca n't be expected to uphold half a century 's worth of precedent and would like to side with religious fascist .
woman who want abortion make horrible decision in their life because they do n't think before they acted
"so ... if a woman is raped and pregnant , she ha to keep and raise the baby ? ? whoever vote for this is extremely selfish and stupid . if you wan na be a mom , do it , do n't force others have to . anti-abortion , fk off ."
"speaking a a short man , i wa disappointed by this ruling . i want to make my wife get an abortion if it is a daughter . i do n't want some shallow girl who only date 6ft tall guy ."
so much for 'land of the free ' pffft
there is no excuse for abortion - it is woman committing so-called legal murder . here are some simple solution to avoid pregnancy : 1 ) keep your leg closed ; 2 ) use contraception ; 3 ) get married first and do thing in the correct order . a man need to be consulted before any abortion a it wa his seed used to create the baby . it is not a woman 's right . suck it up princess and get off your feminist high horse
portapotti instagram model will now have to be careful that they do n't get pregnant by a 12 year old boy or his 90 year old grandfather in dubai . take lot of contraceptive and do n't forget to take them . ha ha
"let me get this right , you cant terminate a foetus now but can gun down kid in a school ? america is fcuked !"
god is so happy with this ruling7:49 why would u murder that innocent unborn baby ..
why dont the bbc show u how the aborted baby look after the abortion just so people have a good image in their mind of what abortion actually doe to the baby ?
a a non religious person . i can not understand how religious people accept 1000 year old belief and have it so engrained in their core .
what doe the government gain from doing this ? more kid in foster care ? satisfaction from a few people ?
"i find ironic what the gop christian conservative did to undocumented child at the border and yet in the same breath say that the life of an undocumented unborn child is more important than abortion right of a u citizen . truth is , this is about religious fascism . we the people shouldnt have to be forced to conform to christian idealism ."
"i understand that most pro-lifer are christian . but , what i do n't understand is how these same christian most likely never even considered fostering child ... something they will have to answer to god on judgement day . the whole reason they 're so adamant about abortion is because it make them feel godly empowered . y'all pro-choicers have to start guilt-tripping the christian into opening their home to foster child ... is n't there a verse that talk about how many will be thrown to hell for not doing thing like feeding the homeless , taking care of the parent-less , etc ?"
it 's none of my business a a christian what unrighteous person do . it 's unchristian to interfere with others .
"i agree with life first , but not by religious involvement in politics . all religion involved will be destroyed soon , amen , you should believe that fact ."
"religious interference in politics did this unbiblical action . jesus commanded his true follower to , `` keep without spot from the world . '' not to get involved in it in any way ."
"amazing how every lefty ha some extreme account to give in an effort to show that abortion is good for woman . if every case wa a the lefty say they are then surely the issue you need to address is abuse on woman , but in your lefty mind the problem is solved by ruthlessly destroying the the one party involved who is the most innocent of all . joe biden judgement day is coming , every doctor making a living of this - judgement day is coming . to all you pro abortionist , you say you will never stop fighting , i want you to know that my brother and i have the armour of god on and we will never stop fighting evil . the battle belongs to the lord and he said the righteous will inherit the land . come , bring your fight , god will have the glory and it will be in your face continuously ."
"any monster that could cruely and violently serial kill their own child , ha serious and extreme mental issue ."
"hmmmm , is it just me , or are the anti abortion woman a bit ugly , and the pro woman pretty ? and i would love to know what the ugly woman meant when she said abortion ha been reeking havoc on community ? surly it unwanted child that are generally more problematic ? just my opinion , but surly only one person ha the right to decide , the woman who is pregnant , not a bunch of protester who have no idea of each individual circumstance !"
"just wondering , is n't there a 3month time period ? i just generally want to know why would someone not get an abortion before that time if you do n't want to have a baby ? i might be wrong though"
"american seem to have some pretty warped ideal . on the one hand they 've outlawed abortion , in thrall to those self righteous , holier than thou type who believe that the moment of conception mean life and it 's sanctity thereof . even though it 's not a sentient being and being no more than a collection of cell , would never be capable of existing outside the womb . conversely - and some may say perversely - we have the thorny question of gun control . it seems the high and mighty can plead the so called 'barbarity ' of abortion . but bringing in rigid gun control is apparently impossible , and so every few week more and more innocent people will be going about their daily routine completely unaware that they 're not going to see another day , because some individual found it way too easy to accumulate a raft of gun and ammo and had got a grievance . american really need to reassess their priority ."
"if these people believe so strongly that they do n't want to get pregnant , why not get sterilised instead ? that way they can sleep about a much a they wo n't and not need to ever have an abortion ."
"wow , the u is going so backwards it 's becoming 4th world country . it already ha no decent healthcare or ha one that kill it 's people , and now this ? ? ? in 2022 ? ? ? this is literally `` back to middle age because the bible said so '' . disgusting ! ! ! ! ! ! how can someone be so evil to want this much to take away basic choice from another ? ! ? ! you leave your life the way you want but to watch to take away this medical right from another ? it 's plain evil ! ! ! ! ! and ignorant , backwards , primitive .. i have no word ! ! !"
those woman in the rally want to kill their own baby ?
"right so let kill kid since ther life will b shit , , , christ u talk about a dead end job so many ppl frm around the world risk everythi ng to escape into america u rt out of touch daniel"
i think it is extraordinary that it wa legal to kill an innocent baby for the convenience of the mother . the baby 's body and soul belong to the baby . the right of the mother do not extend to it . banning abortion is a revolutionary decision . i am very happy to see that no more helpless baby will be deprived of life . i am very pleased . god bless all baby !
society is nutz ! 2 week ago no one knew what defines a woman .
there going to be a lot of feral kid running around the street in america in the coming year
well abortion is always illegal in my country
"i literally have a video from my local news of the catholic church telling the news in an interview that they have spent a lot of money and time on this and wont stop until they achieve it.not all christian people are bad by no mean but this is why , at the least in america , christianity is becoming more and more hated and why there are le and le christian . our government is supposed to leave religious belief out of decision because we are not just a christian nation , we have freedom of religion . but yet everyone trying to pas this have been doing so based on their religious belief . have your christian belief by all mean , but dont force everyone else to live by christian rule regardless of their religion . they will still happen a they did for thousand of year , you only cause more problem with this law . and the fact these dont account for rape and/or abusive relationship that the other person may not safely have an abortion within that window of time if at all , it absolutely absurd . i know if i wa a woman and i wa raped and became pregnant i will find whatever way possible to abort that child till the day of birth . imagine having to live and look after a child from someone who did that to you , especially with feature that person had , fuck that ! that would be hell on earth right there , a very miserable time that doesnt go away ."
the baby is chopped up like a chicken . so happy with this ruling .
"dear bbc . there never wa a `` constitutional right to abortion '' in the usa . you can read the u constitution all you want , but the word `` abortion '' is not there ."
doe n't anybody realise that this is not just about abortion ? this is about taking away the privacy of a woman ! it a woman is pregnant or not is nobody 's business but the woman 's herself ! now if a woman want to travel state in the u she will have to take a pregnancy test first ! this is outright crazy !
"i have n't seen one good looking anti abortionist , so of course they do n't care no one would dare to get them pregnant"
it 's not the fact that the justice were pro-life it 's the fact that the justice were upholding our constitution something the other three and liberal activist failed to ever do
first of all abortion is not outlawed it just go back to the state and there will always be abortion in united state sorry to say . your rhetoric is disgusting a our president or should i say our illegitimate president
what it mean in practice is that individual state make their own mind up about it and the government let 's them do n't see a problem with that i do believe there are case where abortion should be allowed but with strict time restriction that 's my opinion
"my body my choice , except for mask . lol ."
scotus shot down a ruling not a right yesterday . returning it to the state where it should have gone in 73 ! what dems are pissed about is ruling from judge are no longer considered law . pas a law on abortion . no one ever voted on roe v wade . and abortion is not in the constitution ! oh no . . . baby might live ! !
the inmate are truly taking over the asylum .

i am so happy it wa overturned . every child should have the right to live
i agree with libs on one thing . i believe they should not have kid either .
look like margaret atwoods gilead is not far away . i thought america wa a free country
"well that is perfect , go american . get child nobody want and then they can buy gun and kill other child . and the history showed how great it work when abortion are not allowed . so stupid ."
"you people that call evil good and good evil . preserving the ultimate innocence , which is a pure unborn life should be the number one priority for every living female . it an absolute shame and tragedy that it ha to be the government that teach people a basic instinct such a this ."
"if you believe in god and religion , that 's your business . do n't do an abortion . but do n't force your belief on others ."
people need to understand there is a difference between having an abortion because it is `` inconvenient '' and having an abortion because the woman will die ...
"for all those that support abortion , your parent should of had one ."
"you take your seat , instruction for joey biden , alleged leader of the free world . lol ."
50 year of a progressive supreme court ha ended . i never thought i 'd see this day ! god bless america !
"joe biden is far from the tenet of christianity ... he is an anti-christ ... joe biden is a disgrace to christianity and all of you who profess to be christian but support the killing of child because of their size , location and dependence ... god will judge and condemn you all to hell for these act of violence against helpless baby . the blood of these baby will cry after you forever ... except you repent and get right with god . the psalmist said it wa god who joined his bone together in his mother 's womb ! ( psalm 139:13-19 ) psalm 139:13-19 [ 13 ] for you formed my inward part ; you wove me in my mother 's womb .

[ 17 ] how precious also are your thought to me , o god ! how vast is the sum of them ! [ 18 ] if i should count them , they would outnumber the sand . when i awake , i am still with you .

"they 'll just make it illegal without the finantial assistance to the mother . because in reality they do n't care about the mother , they just want their world view shoved down our throat ."

use condom no need for abortion

pro life in the womb but not in a classroom
a an american we no longer ca n't say anything about human right since what the supreme court did stripping woman 's constitutional right to privacy write to her own body and so on and until we fix that .
"having an abortion should not be a crime but a right because there can be a lot of variable leading to it such a rape , incest or unwanted pregnancy due to lack of sexual education or it could be a financial burden if you are struggling to survive . there is also genetic malformation or in rare case such a ectopic pregnancy death of the mother will take place if the pregnancy is not terminated . i do n't believe is a decision that will ever be easy due to moral , emotional or religious belief but the choice should not be criminalized . whether to do it or not should be a personal choice since it is the female individual that will have to carry and deliver the child and later on raise it or decide to have the infant go into an already overwhelmed and broken system ."
i live in georgia and i wa adopted and i wish id never been born my parent were physically and mentally abusive mainly mentally we moved around so much i never got to leave root anywhere and i am also physically disabled now being forced to live in a disability system that force disabled people to live in poverty . i am the living proof that so-called pro life people are in fact not pro life they are only forced birth because if they were truly pro-life they wouldve liked politician to take thing like foster care adoption disability and other social service extremely seriously and would fund them with whatever they needed and with whatever they could instead they routinely elect politician primarily republican who routinely try to restrict these program and right on a regular basis lindsey graham most recently and famously came out in an interview admitting such at least if someone claim to be pro life and yet is a democrat i can somewhat believe them to disagree with them because at least they actually support all the policy that actually make life worth living for million of people .

"abortion is never an easy choice but sometimes it can save life .. brave woman , stay strong in fighting for your right .. edit : i got a lot of hate from people who say foster care is good answer . - there are 400 000 child in foster care , 26 000 age out each year and are instantly homeless - most who age out have disability - child in foster care sre 4x more likely to get saed - more than half of child sex trafficking victim recovered were from foster care/group home - 40 % of foster care kid reported abuse or neglect . do you still think foster care is better ? do you want more baby put in that hell becouse of new system ?"

not cute for semi-fascist bbc to give so much preference to `` pro lifer . ''
"the `` unborn '' ha `` right-to-life '' at the `` point -- of-conception '' . said rep. kevin mccarthy , aspiring 'speaker-of-the-house ' in-waiting . justice thomas of the supremes wrote the opinion to fulfill that belief by overturning a previous ruling over forty-years old , in an unprecedented legal retrogression , to give 'states-rights ' primacy over matter of whether a woman 's right to self-determination regarding her pregnancy is `` trumped '' by a zygote 's `` legal-right '' . the ruling is riddled with self-contradiction . the premise is `` life begin at the point-of-conception '' . those same ideological corner in state ruled by such sweeping fundamentalism , are the same entity which often deny the 'right-to-life ' to those already born . this concept-of-'life ' is rudely terminated at birth . it denies the mother that right , even if continued pregnancy carry the risk of harm to her survival ( or even to the fetus if carried to term while undergoing , say chemotherapy ) . such decision of life and death are best left to the patient and her medical provider . decision of health , made on evidence-based science . not on extreme ideology . another glaring contradiction is this concept of 'right-to-life ' is denied at the gates-of-the-penitentiary , to those on death-row . it is even denied at the gates-of-elementary-school , to little child ( the 'already-born ' ) , barely growing out of the baby-fat gained at birth . their 'right-to-life ' is trumped by the `` right-to-bear-arms '' . why stop there ? actually , we do n't . those ideologue are the same one who think nothing of supporting neo-liberal foreign-policy , which insist on bellicose adventure , by shipping overseas $ 50 billion-dollars worth of weaponry , to fight a proxy-war-of-choice . weapon , some of which -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - > > . . . end up in the hand of mass-shooters , who had legally purchased , such high-powered weapons-of-war to deny the 'right-to-life ' for little-children already-born ."
abortion stats from the abort73 and guttmacher institute website that are dedicated to woman 's right to abortion .. age of woman getting abortion . young girl - 19 = 8.7 % 20-39 = 87 % +40 = 3.7 % the narrative of young woman making mistake is used to cover up grown woman who are using poor management and getting pregnant . reason they got abortion sexual assault and health problem accounted for le than 4 % . 4 % interfere with education 7 % not mature to be a parent 8 % do n't want to be a single mom 19 % done with having kid 23 % ca n't afford a baby 25 % not ready 6 % other so ... the narrative of victimhood and health risk are b to cover up that grown woman have unprotected sex . they do n't want to be inconvenienced by a child . they need american tax dollar to bail them out . i 'm cool with that if the father 's have the right to financially option out of parenthood . woman forced fatherhood on million of men . if woman can delete a baby then father 's should be able to peacefully walk away . that some equality i can vote for .
religion is crippling america ..
what are your british law on abortion ? ? ?
"telling it the way it is . like it or not , i do n't care ! here 's what my position on abortion wa . i did n't care ! i 've always thought a woman should have the right to have a child or not . her body her choice and all that . but then something changed . i heard about a case out of mississippi that wa trying to put limit on when an abortion could take place . not if , only when ! they did n't want to ban abortion , in fact at the time federal law would n't have allowed them to do that . they just wanted to have a say on at what point it 's a person that need protection . well the abortionist did n't want any restriction on when an abortion could occur and that is where they fucked up ! because most american are n't willing to go that far ! in my naive belief on abortion i thought it wa something that wa being done when it wa just a blob of cell in a petri dish , something that did n't even resemble a human , especially not a little human being that could even feel pain , a person ! so once i found out that wa the case i decided to investigate further . and i found out there are people and state that have no problem with aborting all the way up to full term baby and that 's a bridge too far in most american opinion . so yes now it will be an each individual state decision . most people do n't want to live under california or new york law , that 's why they do n't live there . i predict the next big supreme court fight will be , when doe that baby have constitutionally protected right like `` life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . '' at what point is he or she a human being deserving of mercy and a chance to live their life ! at what point doe the unborn baby become the injured party and not the mother ! these are all question that will need to be answered in the highest court in the land ! this time around they will have a whole lot of science to help figure that question out , unlike the 1970s ! just sayin ..."
"nowhere in our constitution is the word abortion or any deritive of it mentioned , so they did not lose any right . your whole lead in is a lie !"
"joe biden correct in 2006 `` i do not view abortion a a choice and a right . i think it 's always a tragedy , and i think that it should be rare and safe , and i think we should be focusing on how to limit the number of abortion . and there ought to be able to have a common ground and consensus a to do that , ''"
"a indian , we are deeply concerned about human right condition in u"
"abortion are still going to be performed . the state will decide for themselves what they want . for me , life begin when new dna is formed . that is , when the sperm fertilizes the egg . i am grateful for the outcome and the blessing that will follow this decision ."

"the right to privacy in reproductive service is what roe wa ultimately decided on . there 's nothing in our constitution about woman or reproductive right . religious organization fought roe because for many , their annual budget relied on adoption fee . newborn are in the highest demand . for century church sought unwed pregnant woman to gain access to newborn to sell or adopt for a fee . the only care about child from gestation to delivery , that 's because they want newborn to fuel their religious organization ."
it all one big satanic mess
feminist want abortion because she want funny sex ....
abortion is murder and abortion is illegal ...
"abortion is woman 's right . okay , you have your right . what about the baby inside your womb ? did he/she told you to abort him/her ? baby should have right too right ? you see , this abortion thing is easy to be settle . it come with your decision at first . why you go and have sex at the first place ? what is the reason ? there you have it . that 's the jackpot and legitimate question . why you had sex at the first place ? for fun ? for what ? now , i know some of these woman are a victim of crime such a raped victim , or poor living condition that lead to early sex . what else , brother and sister doing sex ( do stupid thing ) and so forth . i understand about all of this victim situation and for this reason a well , i do n't encourage them to have an abortion at the first place . no . absolutely not . go to the doctor 's or report your case to the nearest police station for next action taken . a for parent , they have the responsibility to teach their child from an early age about sex and what is right about it and what is wrong . the church and other religious believe need to teach their believer the right and wrong about abortion and having sex . for the law , increase the punishment for those who raped , so that people know that raped is a very serious crime and can lead to heavier punishment by law . lastly , sex is a gift from god and we should use it in the right way . the same thing with baby . it is the gift from god . god is the only one who have the absolute right whether to take life or not . for female , you could learned martial art too , you know , to protect yourself . you never know what will happened to you when you walk by yourself at night . carry weapon too . just for protection ."

"the latin word for medicine ? `` medicina '' it mean the art of healing or mean of healing from medicine , relating to healing , from medeor or medicor to heal or cure . all action of the medical profession belong in the arena of healing and prevention of disease or illness from natural or unnatural cause . abortion is not medical treatment to preserve life or to prevent it 's decline . therefor it can not be place in any category of medical treatment . it ha nothing to do with a denial of a person right . no one ha the right to demand through law a person to take take an action against them that is causing harm and the killing of living cell and life form within the body of a person . harming the woman and the woman in agreement to harming a living life is the real criminal act here . the court have no right to redefine medical treatment a a right to not save life , but to destroy it . a woman may think and feel anything she wish , but she can not force others to agree with her and demand them to pay for destructive action against her and the unborn . there is a distinct difference between medicine preserving life and curing people from disease then using the platform of medicine to destroy ."

pro lifer can lie all they want they only care about their agenda-pro birth not pro life being pro life will harm more woman who will still seek out abortion regardless let life occur naturally-life should not be forced and forced life will sow you plenty of bad karma . one human absolutely should not have a say how another life their life
how about right to life upheld by supreme court bbc ?
"the decision by the supreme court wa done to correct the actual original decision done by the court regarding the issue under debate ( abortion ) . it is the original `` decision '' made by the court that wa incorrect and unconstitutional . the ruling that ha now been corrected ha no effect on the issue of abortion itself . the issue could have been about anything , not just abortion . the decision ha now been corrected and allows for all voice of the people to be heard on the issue under debate ( abortion ) a opposed to only one side , which is what happened a a result of the original incorrect decision made by the court ."
"to the american woman , girl , non-binaries and people with uterus , i am extremely sorry to see this become future for you . stay strong in these dark time ."
abortion is not a constitutional issue !
"maybe now instead of teaching child about gender and pronoun in school , they will teach them that life is precious and that there is birth control . so if they can tell young child to take puberty blocker , they can get young girl sterilettes or free birth control pill and teach boy about wearing condom and responsibility towards their partner ."
"it 's a state right issue . the great thing about america is that if you do n't like how a state is run , you can move . whereas the british government constantly shit on their citizen right and doe n't give a fuck because you ca n't do anything about it ."
"those anti-abortionists are basically trying to bring more people into this overpopulated , overpolluted and resource-scarce world that wa plagued by covid-19 and lockdown , war , terrorism , and having extremely harsh natural disaster brought on by global warming and climate change . it 's like we do n't have enough people to see how ridiculously depressing this world is ."
i know my comment maybe a bit harsh but this may deter young woman of the younger generation to think long and hard about pregnancy and that they ca n't just throw away an unborn life if they have second thought so people need to stop whinging and start thinking that 's what the grey matter is the for
the world continues to laugh at u
how to piss off a lib shyt : keep your baby . own a few gun . stand for the flag . believe in god . work hard . believe in free speech . and now.believe in two gender . that really trigger them !

"what a backwards country . this is a complete step back . first the gun , now this ? terrible news for woman ."
where is america going doe american want to show how conservative they are
"jus mentioning , this ruling doesnt make abortiom illegal , it just give the power of this descision back to individual state and legislature . the sc descision just said that abortion isnt a constitutional right . now it up to the people in the state to elect those who will pas legislate that they want ."
that is one of the most brutal decision to aid abortion and this rubbish country will talk about human right with there rubbish woman
wow ... it amazing to watch a country experiencing a slow burn demise . just another nail in america 's coffin . anti-democractic minority rule will see america go up in flame
"the unborn are fully human the most significant debate is about when life begin . is the unborn child fully human or tissue ? it can not be both . when doe human existence begin ? science say that at nineteen day , a heart start to beat , and at forty day , the heart output is almost twenty percent of an adult . in god eye , an unborn child is entirely a human being . scripture also contends life begin before birth and refers to the unborn and born interchangeably . one is a fully human a the other . for example , god reassures jeremiah , the prophet , of his importance by showing him he wa known before he wa born . god knew him a fully human before his birth . before i formed you in the womb i knew you before you were born , i set you apart ; i appointed you a a prophet to the nation ( jeremiah 1:5 ) . king david wrote about how god knew him fully before he wa born . for you created my inmost being ; you knit me together in my mother womb ... your eye saw my unformed body ; all the day ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be ( psalm 139:13 , 16 ) . when luke writes about elizabeth and mary greeting each other , he speaks of the unborn john the baptist a a baby . when elizabeth heard mary greeting , the baby leaped in her womb , and elizabeth wa filled with theholy spirit ( luke 1:41 ) . to end life through abortion divide life into the unborn and born , and we learn through scripture this opposes god view of both being equally human ."
a lot of unwanted child are going to be fucked up ! good job . america is such a shitshow ! luckily you can just punch a pregnant woman in the stomach and get rid of it that way
"wtf is this . abortion nowadays becamr like going to have a tea . you need to educate your child ! ! this is not a way of protection ! there are some case where it is needed but to have abortion just because you do n't care , it is stupid ."
"no . no `` right to abortion '' wa struck down . the federal government via the court ha handed the right to access this medical procedure back to the individual state . the federal government can no longer force individual state to perform abortion procedure . in any state were abortion is legal ... then abortion is still legal . only in state that have outlawed abortion a of the time of this ruling , is it now illegal . the bbc ca n't even do journalism ."
the right to an abortion wa not struck down . it easier to get an abortion in the u than uk
wonderful day god is great
"abortion is murder and all of you supporting it are forgetting that thats an innocent child . there is no difference between a child in the womb and outside the womb . saying that theyre going to have a hard life mean you are saying people who are poor and endure adversity have le valuable life and would be better off not existing . if you dont want to have a baby then be more careful or dont have sex . if a life get created , it no longer your choice and you dont get to kill a child because it inconvenient to you"
abortion is murder yet a necessary evil . it is primarily liberal who get abortion it go with the mentality . abortion keep democrat from breeding more democrat and that 's a good thing . 20 million black baby aborted 30 million white liberal baby aborted that 's 50 million fewer democrat voter praise jesus .

"my mother got pregnant year ago despite her iud . it caused a very complicated pregnancy that put her life on jeopardy and she had to have an abortion to save her life . my childhood friend dad left . her mom got interned into a psych ward soon after . she worked like a beast to get the best grade and crumbled when she discovered that she got pregnant . she could barely afford rent with the help of her boyfriend and had no family to help . i cant even fathom what kind of life shed have if she didnt have an abortion . ive been severely depressed and anxious for a long a i can remember . at time , i couldnt even function normally without med . i do my best but im still very mentally unstable . if i ever got pregnant and wa forced to give birth , it would be a disaster . with the emotional and physical turmoil that come with pregnancy , it would be a miracle if i make it to the delivery without attempting to end my life ."

rationality prevails !
"god is in control of his people . no more abortion ! no more and no more . my ex told me to abort my last boy , i refused , my boy now is 6 year old boy going to year 2 school class . woman sex is not a fun , sex is responsibility and sacred and when it come to abortion it is life destroyer ! . if it come from rape or sickness ask god to give you grace to carry it . you will not believe what child would be and might be a glorious child that give you that joy you will never expected . stay save woman ."
now you know why every president will stack the scotus with judge of their choice ! hahahahahahahahaha
and it ha nothing to do with the fact that the majority of the scotus are conservative ! hahahahahahahahahahahahaha u give too much power to those unelected judge !
u will get dumber even more a more child with 47 chromosome are born ! more marriage will be wrecked a a result !
"the scotus ruling striking down _roe v. wade_ simply cause this scenario to revert to what it wa prior to january , 1973. i remember in those day , if a woman lived in a state that did n't allow abortion , she simply went to another state where it wa legal , and had the medical procedure done there . again , this procedure * is not * banned in all 50 state a the result of this scotus opinion ."
"why doe abortion exist . so many reason to have one , but what about thinking about not getting into that situation in the first place . why not try to not get pregnant . that go for men and woman . there is always a medical exception and should be allowed . but also i think it 's time for men to prtest that it is not fair that they have no say , especially if they want to give up their right and financial obligation . when a woman decides to not get an abortion , when the father want her to have one , he is forced into child support . in the time we live in , where is the equality ."
it doe n't matter just go to california or the blue state for abortion if the red state ban it . and trust me most of u men do n't want to be father a we will only get divorce raped by alimony and child support . so in a nutshell all this facade is to just hide the inflation caused by the government
abstain or wear condom
"this will lead to more suicide , more woman trapped in violent relationship and more death from backyard coat-hanger abortion ."

"let 's be honest how many little angel are getting killed from abortion or brought to this hell without capable parent . 1 ) drunk women/men not thinking consequence . 2 ) idiotic 17-25 year old people who do n't really care about anything and just do their thing . 3 ) woman who may keep the child for for taking money from their partner . ofc rape , healthy couple that got an accident etc are excluded . i am not against this new law but i do n't support it too ."
i must say that any woman who voted for trump had this coming !
"at one time , abortion were also banned in the ussr . this only led to an increase in criminal abortion , from which woman 's health suffered ."
yea these supreme court justice just bite off way more than they can chew . you know in 48 hour all 6 had their addressee dox all over the internet everyone hate them . i am just going sit back and watch them learn a hard lesson what happens when you are dishonest liar . you told u roe wa decide law in your confirmation hearing ? you think you can lie to the american people and get away with it ? good luck clown

"i am one of the million who are delighted that the supreme court of the united state of america overturned roe v. wade . now , those lefty woman will need to dig into their own wallet to remove a baby from their lefty womb . when i hear them snivel about it ... it make me think about what they are mad about ... and come to the conclusion ... even they do n't know ... or why . thank you president trump for your part in this ... naming three conservative to the supreme court of the united state of america !"

"yay , people 's belief get to control a major medical procedure for woman and young girl . hooray . ( giving birth is a major medical procedure and no one can do it for her . )"
republican liked a handmaid tale so much they are doing their best to make it a reality in america .

"abortion is neither a right nor healthcare . it 's murder . it state clearly , `` the right to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . '' no mention of abortion . sorry , nice try . and since when is murder considered `` healthcare '' ? that 's right . never . i 've pondered many medical journal and law , scrubbed the internet up one side and down the other . no mention of murder being healthcare ..... what i have , in fact , found is murder is illegal and healthcare is to preserve life ."
abortion ban ? what about the human right ? usa is the self appointed contractor of world human right . doing injustice with their own people regarding the abortion ban . see their hypocrisy .
"in 1973 seven white male judge took it upon themselves to force their view of a highly divisive political issue on the entire nation . today , 4 white male , a black male and a white woman finally overturned the 1973 decision and allowed this contested issue to be legislated democratically and ultimately by the people . no matter what side you 're on it is a great day for america , for our constitution and for our democratic republic . a great day for woman , the unborn and human right ."
"for my british/european friend who are being duped into believing that this is `` a step backwards , '' by the fear pornographer ( the medium ) . all this ruling doe is return the issue to the state . it 's what we call federalism . abortion is no longer in the federal purview where it did n't belong in the first place . you may be surprised to learn that some state , like california or new york , will probably make abortion even easier to get then during roe . this is all the left 's fault btw . a part of their asinine woke revolution , they tried to make any abortion for any reason , early trimester , late term , the day before birth , legal . and ... they demanded that those abortion be taxpayer funded . it 's all related to their idiotic premise that gender is oppressive and woman , er ... excuse me `` birthing people , '' are being oppressed by this tyrannical `` fetus '' that they do n't want freeloading inside of them and making them be responsible . oh ! the humanity ! and right on cue , enter donald trump ..."
this is great news for wire coat hanger company .
they do realise there a thing called birth control yeh ?
"a trump inadvertently ha one by one taken our freedom away . little boy and girl walk to their new day gas chamber called school . do safety drill that are ineffective , in class room which become make shift slaughter house . we cant abort , knowing his mum should have . next condom then metal coat hanger . no wall needed here the u is involved in a civil war , we the people v american homegrown terrorist . trump ha served his purpose and shown the whole world what greed fear and hate can accomplish . merica at present not so free not so great"
"u one of the country where they have sex the most .. thats why that matter so much . folk just wear condom duuuh you need to grow up and take responsibility be accountable for your stupid decision when copulating though cant avoid to say that this ha also a huge positive impact to the usa economy in the next decade to come . to maintain the country you need young paying elder pension importing young people from abroad it not a good deal . indeed , when applying for a work visa if you see statistic the majority are over 40 with a family theyll work in u and go back to their country . work visa only for senior with lot of experience co gov dont want to spend money training them . so you need young work force that the gov dont want to bring from abroad so you got ta do the work and toss out child . hope that the law ha some kind of twist for woman raped . go usa"
"there should be grief counseling for people thinking about killing their child . they should also be told what actually happens to the baby . and how corporation profit from the little body . if woman die from abortion , then they die , are they not committing murder on the innocent , our future . these pro abortion people should have been aborted"
and yet thinking before having sex with everyone is a solution not an abortion .

i read that child protective service ha real problem and need to be overhauled and revamped so these poor child can really be cared for and possibly adopted into `` loving '' home . i 'm sure there are some good people ; but there is a lot of corruption at the top that is failing the child and just lining their own pocket

million of child born who will care for the child whose mother are unable to care for them ... a lack of money a lack of maturity what of the child born a a result of rape ? r stupid stupid selfish men no where near when they have to pay child support ! ! ! !
"i have a good idea , how about all men , especially those who are most opinionated get vasectomy at birth , so then when couple are ready for child , they get it reversed . would n't this vastly reduce the need for abortion ?"
"it would be interesting if people , even the very poor and destitute , make a mass exodus outside of these state if they fear that they may need these service at any moment , and that the population demographic shift , but i think what will happen instead are that people will just not get a many abortion in those place , wo n't drive out of state , and will just carry the pregnancy to term or will find way to stop the pregnancy which are illegal in those area . i might have preferred that people leave state and no longer pay tax in state where they feel the government is not representing them properly , or otherwise , if they wish , stay there and wage political campaign to get those state to make thing legal that they want to be legal , but the problem is , it appears the majority in some place may actually not be like them or on their side , so it would be hard to convince a new group of people to be the majority , to move in a bunch of people who will become the majority otherwise , and it seems much more easy to just leave , even if one ha to hitchhike out of a place , and start a new life elsewhere . i might also not mind if a lot of people decide to leave america altogether , maybe not directly regarding this issue , but just in general , seeing a how unstable it ha seemed to become , how polarized , how crime-filled and dangerous it seems to be , it just might not be worth living there anymore , except in very out of the way place without much action or social interaction . it is extremely difficult for people to leave the country though since other country do n't typically allow such a thing , but people should definitely try , even if it take measure such a marrying people in other country or whatever is necessary , even illegally entering those country potentially , if it is a decision between living in poverty in some crime filled place or getting out and being free from america and the scary state it is currently in ( for the last decade basically , and really since bush jr. ) ."

"i can personally say that i 'm happy that the people who support abortion will rally together to continue to support it . i do not support it and i am happy to know that my tax dollar are not going towards the funding of something i , personally do not believe in . a an american citizen it 's my right . a an american citizen it 's also the right of the people to rally together to support the cause that speak to them personally . the medium always make one side louder than the other . i would like to hear from the mother who have struggled and despite their struggle honored their belief not to abort their child and have still persevered . i know them personally . they spent countless hour studying for degree , working at strip club , doing hair etc. , so they can take care of baby that they did not plan for . we never seem to hear from those woman . i 'm sure single parenthood in general is not easy but we all have our choice to make . whether they 're right or wrong it 's not for anyone to judge but it 's everyone 's right to support the cause that they deem worthy ."

"ironically , the same democrat who pushed mandatory vaccine and decried grievance against the 2020 election a the end of democracy are complaining about a real return to democracy . we thought that wa democracy and yet the very people whove been lecturing u for year about democracy it the end of democracy are horrified by the return of democracy , carlson said . theyre telling u the legitimacy of our institution is at risk and yet they can not allow voter to have a say in how they live . what doe that tell you ? it tell you they care about power , not popular support . since the supreme court ruling , over a dozen state have already banned abortion a a result of trigger law on their book . california and new york lawmaker , on the other hand , have vowed to make their state sanctuary for abortion access . democracy is already in action . leftist freak that scotus ha overturned their ability to kill unborn"
"roe wa one of those decision you never heard anyone defend on it own term . lot of people want legal abortion , but no one ever explained how exactly the constitution guarantee that , carlson explained . roe wa a political document . it wa not a legal opinion and for that reason , it existence degraded and undermined the legitimacy of the supreme court , one of our country central institution . it wa poison . the purpose of the supreme court is simple . it to determine whether the law that politician pas are consistent with the united state constitution . thats it . thats all the supreme court doe . carlson explained that the issue of abortion is now left up to individual state , exactly a democracy and the american political system is supposed to function . what the supreme court doe not do , what it can not do and should never do is make law and it should never do that because a court making law would be , by definition , anti-democratic , carlson noted . none of the nine supreme court justice ha been elected by anyone . all of them have lifetime appointment . if you cared about democracy and wanted democracy to continue , you would demand that all law in the united state be passed by elected legislature . again , no matter how you feel about abortion or any other specific issue . in a democracy , voter have the final word on how they are governed . thats what democracy is . which mean if some state want abortion , their legislature can vote for it . if not , they wont , the fox news host said . now , after nearly half a century , voter have had their right restored on the question of abortion . if they like abortion , they can vote to legalize abortion . if they dont like abortion , they can vote to ban abortion . thats not shocking . that is how our system is supposed to work , not being a monarchy and all . so , whats the argument against this ? well , there isnt one , really and we know that for certain from the dissent in today supreme court ruling ."

perhaps these same judge should pas a law which state that all men/boys have a vasectomy unless they are legally married . you can bet that those same judge would never pas this a a law . you can also bet there would be hundred of thousand of men who would loudly protest . the law should be equal for woman & men . plus what are these same judge going to ensure that american men take care of the child they have already created ? how many single woman are out there financially taking care of their child but the men of those same child are not forced to actually pay the child support they are required to pay .
"if woman are in position where they want or need an abortion but legally ca n't , and the man who got her pregnant doe n't want to keep it or help raise it ... he should automatically be given a vasectomy . it take two to put an unwanted child in a uterus . apparently , conservative are saying that the door is kicked open now for going after same sex marriage and contraception . the conservative ball ha started rolling and america is soon to be obsolete on the world stage and moving back towards mccarthyism-thinking with a heavy dash of fascist rule added to it ."
"ok men get the snip what is that a no then stop forcing woman to go ahead with pregnancy that you would n't stay around for , what about all the unwanted abused kid in state care where is the love there ffs , ok then it should be made illegal to get a woman pregnant and fuck off then stupid world"

"well done america , give god back glory"

the thing that annoys me most about people saying keep your leg close to woman is that it never mention the male.why are woman getting all the blame when it take two to make a baby and it not just woman protesting why are they being targeted because they are the one to carry the baby . if your going to tell u woman to keep our leg close than i expect you to at the very least say keep it in your pant fella thank you for reading have a nice day .

1998 biden wanted abortion
press s to spit of ginsburg 's grave
"5:20 roe v. wade wa overturned , because the country care about people ! it care about the unborns and it care about the mental and moral maturity of the woman ! a mentally and morally healthy woman would know to only have sex with a man she want to spend life and start a family with , because sex can lead to a pregnancy and a child ! child murder is n't a human right !"
"so if you are pregnant with a 11-fingered , 2-headed baby from a rape , your only option is to kill it after giving birth to it ?"
woman fought for over 100 year to take control of their own body ! now the republican and those who use religion that they have forced view on the people ! country is going in the wrong direction . thanks to the republican . if they had it their way out country would be run by a single ruling party . which would lead to a dictatorship . both sex should protest this action that the republican have made to our society !
this never ha been a right to murder .
"2:30 a woman , trying to kill her child , doe n't deserve to live and deserves to die !"
this news ha literally brighten my day . my heart feel so much joy . god ha truly spoken . what 's wrong with being sexually responsible . these baby should not endure pain because of the parent bad decision making . people just think about themselves . and that selfish ! baby life matter too
no right to child murder ! consent to sex is consent to pregnancy and consent to a child !
america stay over there . sick in the head .
narrow minded jesus loving ignorant idiot .

the doctor only mad cause that paycheck stopping
fat girl at 1:22 chanting `` life won today '' ha never seen a cock and doe n't want anyone else to enjoy sex
it ironic that the people that support abortion are out protesting and screaming must secretly be thinking im glad my parent didnt abort me .

here is an idea . abstinence is 100 % effective at preventing unwanted pregnancy . here is another idea ; let 's kill the parent of rape victim instead of the child of rape victim . how about that ? here is another idea ; stop killing the child for the immoral activity of the parent ! ! !
do they not think how over populated we already are ? maybe make abortion available in 3rd world country of you wan na take it away from american absolutely pathetic
how sad people cant kill baby anymore
"unfortunately , this mass butchering of baby will likely continue in the democrat demonic blue state . in california and new york out of defiance , it might even increase . overall , though , the infanticide number will almost certainly decrease . and those number are almost too horrific to comprehend . since roe became the law of the land in 1973 , 63 million innocent baby have been slaughtered . sixty-three million life were snuffed out , almost all for convenience purpose . every life saved by the supreme court dobbs decision is an innocent and precious life"
no right are given to people tryna give death sentence to baby
the people who should be made responsible - both physically and financially - for taking care of those baby through to adulthood are the pro-life campaigner . or . all male need to be given the snip . let see how quickly the law are changed then ! ! !
religion is a chosen lifestyle for the weak of will . they should not be making decision for others .
say goodbye to bodily autonomy
i hate the fact that if we give it a few more year when most the older people die out it will probably change again : /
now men can spread their seed the reason i 'm here is because .my father told and my mother in 1959 that if she aborted me he wa going to lock her up and now .l have two five child 21 grandkids and five great grant .
the legacy of trump in the u will have consequence for decade to come and not in a good way .
"it is funny they fight for killing baby using abortion but the only reason any of them are here is the fact that their mother did not abort them . this is an issue that ha been pushed to control people . it is a lie , it put the issue back to the state . it is not in the constitution . 50 million baby have been murdered , it is eugenics pushed on our black and poor community and now bill and melinda gate are building abortion clinic in africa . it is the will of the people , roe v wade wa a fake , it wa planned and used to push planned parenthood , she never had an abortion , her daughter is alive today even though her mother gave her up . you are only shown these few instance and not the evil side of abortion . these people are pushing abortion at the moment of birth and allowing the mother and doctor to kill the child while it is alive . it is a for profit organization that earned $ 1.9 billion last year and received $ 528 in government money . they sell the fetus to lab for experimentation and the clinic and doctor receive money for it . what about the dumpster of aborted baby . stop pushing propaganda . it is totally out of control . my body , my right is not true , it is not the mother body it is the child ' body . the left and our education system ha brainwashed all these young people mind for decade . it is about money and control , not woman health ."
it almost like someone want to keep u fighting with each other
"ah , yes . religion . keeping humanity from progressing , since it inception . or , in this case , actually regressing humanity by a good fifty year in one fell swoop . idiotic beyond belief ."
"they 're going to build a better world with more unwanted or under cared for child ... i guess . this mean the state can choose to outlaw abortion even if the mother at risk . i hope most state have the foresight to protect woman from potential harm , but i do n't have much faith in red state legislator . they care more about the unborn than they do about those of u who are here right now . trump and the republican had a chance in 2017 to change our life for the better when they had full control over congress and the presidency , but chose to focus on temporary tax relief for the poor and middle class while giving the wealthiest like trump and his family permanent tax break , and packing the scotus to overturn the right to an abortion . let 's not forget about their `` 2nd amendment right '' to kill child who are alive and breathing once again showing they do n't care about u ."
america is a sh * thole . may god have mercy on it citizen .
a victory for pregnant men worldwide praise jebus

"more jesus , better america"
"there 's no such thing a a `` right '' to abortion , you do n't get to murder defenseless child out of convenience , your right stop where the right of other begin ; leftie liberal always say `` my body my choice '' but never mention the baby 's body and the baby 's choice which is disgusting ; if you do n't want a baby then be a responsible grown-ass adult and do n't have sex or buy a condom , they 're super cheap and easily available . p . congratulation from mexico to all american patriot for this beautiful victory , this is a glorious and delightful development ! i couldnt help but notice that everyone who is for abortion , have already been born -president ronald reagan"
"perverse behaviour , fornication , sexual immolarity , premarital sex is cause of abortion . let deal with the cause . encourage american to abstain from sex until they are married ."
why cant woman just keep their leg together ? is it so hard ... yes thats why they cant .

"the united state will be more divided than it is now , many of the state will ask for their independence and probably will have it , not only on the abortion issue but also on gun control . a civil war is coming"

"white supremacy ... 100 year ago a white supremacist woman named sanger started an organisation to control what she considered to be undesirable through eugenics ... today that organisation is actively murdering minority child at a rate way faster than the murder of white child ... the damage doesnt stop there ... once a person ha destroyed his or her own child he/she ha destroyed a piece of his/her own soul ... the pain lead to drug use , alcoholism despondency and destruction . m sanger 's dream of destroying the minority in america is being seen everyday in the inner city everywhere in america and liberal black leader are cheering her on !"

"how about telling the truth for once ? you do know this doe n't make abortion illegal right ? it leaf it up to the state to decide . of course you know that , but you need rating ."
this country would be better if we executed all conservative .

separation of church and state need to happen right now .
"in a democrat state that allows abortion up to 9 month , is n't that murder ? if i were to kick a pregnet woman in the stomach and she lost the unborn child i should be charged with assault only because under their logic the unborn child is not a life . but in those very same state there are people in prison for murder for killing a unborn child . the hypocrisy of what go on in some liberal state 's is unbelievable ."
what happened to all life matter
"anti-abortion is mostly christian/catholic belief . however the united state constitution state there should be division between the state and religion . even jesus said `` give to caesar what is due to caesar '' . leave the issue of the state , to the state . do not meddle . you are forcing your belief to atheist , buddhist , muslim , jew , hindu of this country . because you are forcing them to follow christian belief , they will go away and think of christian very badly . jesus never forced anyone to convert to christianity nor follow the commandment . he preached and showed love to anyone who will listen ."
"i love the democracy end the freedom of speech in this soil am sure back in my home land africa , if found expressing ur thought in the street , all these citizen would have been swept to prison cell # safe abortion # aright"

it crazy to see woman who are pro life
yay good news ! so glad for this ! child deserve to live !
"imagine being one of the idiot in the crowd chanting . this ai n't a good thing because abortion will still be done , just now much more painfully and unsafely ."

democracy is going to die in america n india . all the best future citizen
this is the most perfect law in u . it will save a lot of people life and will make woman take more responsibility of their pregnancy .
they are not pro life they are pro breeder
"it 's hilarious that these people think they had anything to do with this . the supreme court did n't do this because these people changed their mind , they did it because a bunch of conservative crony with too much bible and not enough brain , put in by another cronie with no brain , made a very very stupid decision . pub are always bitching about paying for people that are in poverty . just wait until they see how many more of them there will be now . a pregnant teenager will now have virtually no chance a a life . and science is not on your side , little girl , science clearly show that more population is the last thing this world need . but soldier on , idiot . when other aspect like the environment really start to go south i can tell you who will be bitching most , too . all i can say is anyone with three working brain cell to rub together better have a few morning after pill set aside ."

"i dont agree with total prohibition on abortion just a i dont agree with legislating abortion from the bench . congress should do their job and pas a common sense abortion law . prohibiting all abortion is extreme just a allowing late term and mid term abortion . i doubt the average person care if an abortion is had in the first trimester but i doubt theyre ok with it at 7 , 8 , 9 month . common sense and compromise must return or we will tear ourselves apart ."
abortion is murder .
"it is not woman taking woman 's right away but seven men , just like they did in the past by our ancestor !"

"there will be illegal abortion , and this will endanger woman more.think about poor woman who wo n't be able to achieve it . think about the woman who get raped and get pregnant and do n't want the child ? think about a woman who got pregnant accidentally and who ca n't afford a living for herself ? think about the cost of living ? the world is changing more recession , poor woman will suffer the most ."
"we are in a new age , not old custom age . woman should be allowed to choose . pro-abortion doe not make any woman get an abortion , only if that woman chooses too . if they dont want to give woman right to choose then let also go back to the stone age and hit woman on the head with a stick pull their hair and use them to mate , just because these thing were done by caveman doe not mean we still do it . give woman their respect and allow them to choose ."
"the real solution is flirt with the right person , or dont get knocked so easy , why is that so hard ? ? learn self defense early so you dont get knocked either , if we are powerful woman why we get knocked so easy ? deal with it if you do , properly . let 's all start new , do not be weak , you dont need this law if you become wise ! flirt with the right person , even if it take you till you are old ! clean slate for america ! besides , think where the fetus end , potentially in the mouth of the elite rich for food , gross but investigate , why feed them more ?"

"yesterday wa a victory not only for republican and conservative , but for all of life , when i see child being thrown into garbage can because of abortion and i see people defending abortion a if it were normal , a if one had the right to speak for a life that can not defend itself , and that i realize that the human being ha not learned anything that the life of the next is disposable , my regret to all the child who were killed due to abortion and had no one to defend them , more yesterday justice wa done . congratulation republican you proved that some people still have a conscience , thank you very much ."
"i mean they are technically living the american dream , considering most of them dont seem to even be awake . abortion get re-illegalized if that even is a word , free healthcare something that should be a basic human right somehow is being politicised and i bet you 500 they 'll try to chip away at the very recent law of legalising gay marriage because when a basic right like abortion is stripped away , there is a 50/50 chance they 'll try to do it with other basic human right law . i mean sarah the reporter literally said that they 're maybe other progressive right the supreme court could be looking into getting them removed so what are the odds of seeing a slave in virginia being used to produce cotton again ?"

"they say , `` we 're letting the state decide . we 're delegating that authority to them .

"baby life matter , i dont think people realize how many people want child . they are willing to pay thousand for them bear . while i feel rape and health are ok for it but , i 'm tired of people playing god in more than just abortion . we have a democracy so we can choose who better suit that party and their own belief . everyone deserves to be married i 'm ok with that . why is it the same people wanting to murder baby protest dog shelter from putting down dog because no one want them ? why is it the same people put like on story of premature baby that survive the odds and grow up to be beautiful people ."

most of the state that want abortion outlawed are the lowest in the educational system ..
"here 's a commonsense solution . use contraceptive , two different type concurrently . this is n't the 1800 's ."
"finally a supreme court made up of rational , intelligent jurist have overturned the prior unconstitutional supreme court decision that enabled the immoral and abhorrent killing of baby in the womb !"
"america sure need a sweeping change , i hope this is going to be the beginning of many more to come ."
"crazy nazi satan church pastor 's is giving the republican party of the supreme court justice and the young republican congress party member and group are , pushing horror on the usa people . the church pastor 's are giving instruction of what to do , what to say , what to think , and who to kill especially cop . the young republican congress party is also taking it order for the usa people , it come from the crazy nazi satan church and it 's pastor 's . the bible doe n't talk about abortion , no where in it , god ha nothing to do with what happened on 6/24/2022 the nazi republican party"
"what a misleading title , abortion wa never a right outlined in the constitution to begin with , the supreme court simply ruled that the power be returned to the people within the individual state where it belongs . many american are too stupid and lack the wherewithal to understand how their representative republic wa designed to operate , not realizing that 'state 's right ' won this victory , which is a beautiful thing . removing power from a centralized federal entity and placing that power back into the citizen 's hand is what seperates america a a free republic from country elsewhere in the world where citizen are actually subject under centralized authority , a an american myself i 'm thoroughly embarrassed with most of my countryman who do not even understand that they live in a republic , cry for government tyranny just so they can feel a though they are safe under a nanny state 's control mechanism ... so pathetic ... ! ! !"
isnt it just up to the state now ? you can go to another state ... it not like they made it nationally illegal-just no longer a federal issue .
the problem with america is too much extreme freedom
bbc 's sex education should not go to waste
people want to so much right to escape accountability and responsibility . prior to 1973 the abortion wa illegal unless the mother 's life wa in danger . make sense to me . you ca n't just take unborn life when you want .
america is not the land of the free anymore .
abortion is murder and an abomination ! you who support abortion will regret it when you get to be in the presence of our mighty creator !

"bbc that 's better ! ! ! ! now they need to abolish gay marriage too.no abortion , better future ."
"this is good news , now there hopefully mwont be a many hoe ."
"if people want to overturn the human right of abortion , they should have been aborted ."
soo why didnt they stop it ? ?
"this will affect our economy greatly , not only economy but sexual crime a well . more family will be on welfare .... job competition n economical resource ...."
america and human right are two opposite thing . america didnt think for afganistan people before .. now their own woman citizen are in trouble .. shameful
psm 127v 3 child are gift from god . how do you view this most precious gift ? . are you thankful ? do you appreciate this gift from almighty god ?
"have responsible sex , the choice wa made once you spread your leg . give more awareness to sex safety and pregnancy prevention , not termination once it allready too late ."
no this should n't be celebrated . if she 's raped she ha to go through 9 month of an unwanted baby . give birth and have the memory have the baby she did n't want in her body because she wa raped and `` she must 've not fought back '' . this is disgusting
america eating itself .
good to hear the u is going one-step to the right . the federal government ha no business forcing everyone to fund killing baby for the convenience of woman . let the state decide what they want .
if you people would turn to the god that gave life to youuuuuuu .... then you would happily give up your job of death ! ! ! ! !
"all the ruling state is that individual state decide , it not illegal , just not a constitutional right ! we are so far off with compassion politics that we forget how simple the law is ."
land of the free !
"maybe people should care about the kid that are alive breathing and thinking and are actually right now in many orphanage instead of thinking over a meat apple of an underdeveloped fetus that likely is going to end up in one without a parent , or worse be born and die while feeling pain early in life ? if people care about life so much they sure did n't show it that way towards the one that are currently alive and walking . the homeless , the ill , the kid without parent or kid with mental disability ? this is just ... hypocritical ."
"woman are losing their right every day . this country wa supposed to be free but a always it is just for the straight white , christian/catholic male . this is religious coercion . what happened to the separation of church and state ?"
great day in america ! the state get to chose their path based on what their resident want . the people supporting are evil . look at what they are wearing ! loser !
i love this so much god bless the supreme court .........................................................................................
wait did they remove abortion now ? ? ? if yeh then good because i think it bad to take away an innocent baby life away and it not right but i understand that people are not okay with it
"gas is $ 5 a gallon and you have to drive out of state to get rid of the bump in your belly ..... lol , you voted for it"
"do they really think , banning abortion will end it ? people will do abortion illegally which increase the risk ."
another nail in the coffin of liberty in the self proclaimed `` land of the free '' . at this rate the usa is going to end up about a free a iran . it will become that which it purport to oppose .... a despotism under the rule of mob violence and the tyranny of fanatical religious nut-jobs . the same lawmaker who applaud this decision are the very same who viewed the massacre at uvalde with cynical indifference . presumably they do n't think there are enough child to provide target practice in american school .
look at the bright side . more child around . i do n't hate child . . now who here hate child ? i have nephew and niece .
"thank you , trump . unlike other politician , you delivered ."
"these day being a progressive involves murdering your unborn baby , chopping your genitals off and taking child to story time read by a pervert in a dress ."
"dependes on situation im for abortion , yes u have rape baby or a fun bed baby a t early age mom dad no job , gandperants stuck with baby or system place baby who know to who baby get abuse , i can go on and on .yes must to abortion save the baby from evil world.those are my feeling , i belive at time do what u have to do .let creator juge me ."
it 's a great day million of fewer innocent baby will be murdered
"@ 5:20 lol , the irony"
youre not pro choice . youre pro death to the most innocent among u .
people should look up who started planned parenthood and after you read the story of the woman that started planned parenthood and her reason for starting planned parenthood i think a lot of people are going to change their mind about planned parenthood not only that people will be shocked
well you better have great social service because orphanage will sure have alot of customer to serve soon .
right to abortion struck down by u supreme court - false . u supreme court supreme court decision reversed federal law and turn abortion back over to the state thats it thats all this doe . the headline is propaganda . abortion is still legal in 35 state with some state have some restriction . 3 more state and dems can pas a amendment to the constitution guaranteeing it a a constitutional right . but democrat want a wedge issue to win election . roe v wade wa court decision made into law circumvented the democratic process . roe v wade wa illegal . court in the u do n't make law congress doe . the court making law is anti-democracy . so regardless if you 're for or against abortion the federal mandate wa unconstitutional . if dems do n't get off their bum conservative will use the law to go after gay marriage in the same way . gay marriage wa made into law by executive order . not by congress .
abortion is crime ! after enjoyng from the bed ! u will killed so stupid ! ! ! pro life pro god ! !
forced motherhood ? nobody is forcing motherhood . just practice sex safety . abortion is just baby killing pure and simple
"her boyfriend hit her every day , but she sleep with him ."
"finally a light in the dark ! the business with the baby is finished , lord , give wisdom to these woman , so that they take better care of themselves ."
amen no abortion
"this comment section is so scary . i ca n't believe we still have to claim that woman 's right are human right . ffs . greeting from germany where , on the same day a the u supreme court overturned roe v. wade , our highest court overturned a law prohibiting doctor to openly discus their abortion practice . all u woman are in my thought and will be in my action ."
# life ha one this day .
all they 've done is ban safe abortion and put million of girl and woman at risk .
one more thing to overcome same sex marriage
"i am so glad i am not from america gun , no abortion , no simple human right like control of your own body it crazy"
if you do n't want kid keep your lages closed . abortion is only a choice for those who do n't want to take responsibility for their action .
wait a min wa that cat ear
look at how many child in foster care.look how many child are in the system already no one wants.look how many child parent killing all due the parent did n't want.why do n't these people adopt these kid 's give them family and a home ? do they really think by overturning this will stop abortion ? no it will not.theirs going to still be a lot of abortions.just not done in a medical office.but it will still happen.who are them to tell woman what they can and ca n't do to their body's.our body 's should not be in their hands/white house vote.my choice my body i choose .
wonderful news . give the unborn a voice . do these people really believe that god will say the killing of an unborn child is ok ?
it 's crazy how people struggle in usa to kill baby . i mean at their point thing are fair cuz most of the ppl in their society are lack of self morale and discipline . finally the kid are the one who gon na suffer for a lifetime
"finally : justice reading the constitution a it is written ! not pulling right like rabbit magically out of their black hat . abortionist : `` boohoo , we can not murder innocent infant anymore . so upsetting ! ''"
prolife ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
why supreme court so desperately want to bring a baby into the world when their parent are not ready for it . who is gon na take care of those kid . i think this is all done to please the votebank of orthodox christian community . welcome to stoneage america .
"woman will continue to try to have abortion a they did since of the begining of time , but now they will put their life at risk , trying to do it themselves or going to place that will do it with metal hanger and die from infection ."
"stupid young girl being happy about it . woman will continue to try to have abortion a they did since of the begining of time , but now they will put their life at risk , trying to do it themselves or going to place that will do it with metal hanger and die from infection ."
no it wasnt . it wa put in the hand of each state to decide .
life ha indeed won ! praise god
"just because someone decided to abort there pregnancy doe n't mean it 's easy . it 's one of the hardest thing to decide for yourself . it can be mentally draining , but if they feel like it 's still the right thing to do then they should have the right ! ! ! ! ! to decide if they want to do it . people who think it 's just killing a life , are n't thinking of everything else ."
all life should be protected
"american woman should start going out more with colored men . watch how quickly they will overturn the ban . . besides , colored men have bigger dingdongs ."
"so america is going to listen to a bunch of religious extremist , sentencing countless woman to death and trauma . blood on scotus ' hand"
thank fuck sanity prevails
"a usual , the bbc ha got their fact and their opinion all twisted . 1. the scotus did not simply out law abortion across the country . what they did is leave the decision to do abortion up to the individual state . 2. there is no provision in the u constitution guaranteeing the right to have an abortion . what ha happened to the bbc ! ? did you get bought out by cnn ? ? get your fact straight , report only the fact , and stop trying to stir up fear and anger with your wild , unfounded opinion ."
now there will be million of homeless hungry baby
great day for all those unborn child . god bless the surpreme court .
"recently , the ccp began to use it diplomatic power to explain it own fault to the world , and then demanded sympathy from all country , and once again lured and bribed dignitary from various country . dont you know the essence of the ccp ? when he retreat , it is in exchange for time and space for the next attack . a long a he is soft-hearted towards him , he will have to move forward . have you ever seen the gangster society ? a for trump , if he take office , he will bring the united state with him . . to hell , because he is a selfish person , he doe not understand liberalism , he doe not understand the spirit of the founding of the united state , the founding of the united state and the establishment of the constitution , and can only say that he is a businessman . and pompeo is the future president who will truly lead the united state to the right path . for u foreigner , he will be a good president . he can maintain peace in the entire world because he ha a righteous heart . today , china 's bank and real estate are bound to each other . they have a set of fund , which they transfer around and support each other . a long a the people withdraw and run on the money , there will be a series of thunderstorm , because the ccp ha no money and all bad debt . it 's all fake cover up ."
stop freaking out . it 's up to the state not completely abolished . bbc stop saying the right to abort is struck down !
"god bless u all , keep growing , unite eachother help each other"
maybe if the democrat did n't want to use abortion a political football they would have codified this during the clinton administration or the obama administration ... i 've heard political operative say they would never pas it because it 's too useful a weapon to use against the right .
"reminder that this wont drop abortion rate , it will just mean more woman die from unsafe abortion , and that 's exactly what republican want . having this type of power over people make these justice feel important ."
"im not about abortion being used like candy but at least have exception like r word , insests , if having baby can kill the mom- like health situation . im sure woman are would be more inclined to go for that . this is all population control - control that men are trying to get back . cant believe being a woman is so hard today . this wa a great way to move backwards ."
"red pill fact : if 'some ' woman were more responsible with their body , had some self-respect and respect for the unborn , abortion ( minus rape/incest ) would never exist . mic drop ."
oh my god thank god i 'm not living in the state i feel sorry for woman who are now going to be forced by law to raise a child for all we know could be the end result of a rapist having his way with some poor girl imagine that looking at a child and seeing your attacker face ! completely moronic country and the people celebrating that verdict only highlight that stupidity they have no idea what they 've done idiot ! ! ! !
anti-abortion is better than destroying the future generation of humanity . maybe our country will finally grown stronger again instead of weaker .
those anti-reproduction right gender traitor will be haunted by the death of woman and child that this will cause .
u is the most advanced country in the world compared to the europe because it doe not cater to feminist hoe
good job . woman with bad moral are protesting
oh shut trump up . he 's only campaigning for vote .
i support the baby killer
"i want to hear how they are going to help the unwanted child , shelter , food , medical , education let alone family love . to grow up unwanted b & possible abuse"
so now i 'm the criminal what you going to do charge me you going to charge me are you going to charge me for trying to push your ass to do the right thing make me a criminal at least i became a criminal for the right reason
"bruh at least report correctly on the issue , abortion is not federal banned it is now up to the state to regulate the issue ."
why is this headline news here in the uk . who care what the usa doe . dont see much coverage by the bbc of those that support the removal of the law in question . just another biased bbc low quality piece of journailsm
"the ruling simply put the law to local ( state ) lawmaker , what most news is not saying is the democrat control all 3 house to make law , but instead blame the justice who read the law , why are they not doing what they preach ? ? ? ?"
"we are acting like these being are an item u can cancel on amazon . what determines your death ? no pulse , then what should it determine at the beginning a pulse ( heartbeat ) it not a baby out the womb it been a baby since the heart beat . these crazy people make me"
first step to a responsible society
"too bad the title of the video is entirely misleading , they are not banning abortion , they are leaving it up the to the state to decide . which is fair because some place believe that killing baby is ok and same dont . california wacko want abortion up to 9 month dont know if anybodys seen a woman 9months but shes about to pop at the that point and you can kill it then . when are woman gon na take the responsibility of either wearing protection or dont sleep with everyone . no common sense with these people . u can be poor and take care of child just fine i have several kid dont make a lot and they are all happy and fine just got ta sacrifice . people that are for abortion up to 9 month is sickening . do yalls homework and grow a heart"
we thank god .
hmm american
this is all because of the f * * * ing bible bashers
and thank you guzman family mexican latin american minority majority and everyone else for making this a priority when those administrative level office did n't
i 'm so mad at this and i do n't even live in america i wan na choke every single one of those people who are defending this decision .
decision a big a this decided by 9 people . why do we have voting and election ? seriously
ten of million of woman in america do not understand where baby come from ? contraception is cheap and available everywhere . i 'm sorry but abortion is not a form of health care nor contraception and those are still available to woman .
final justice for the million of unborn baby sacrificed to the devil
finally killing baby are over
this is like the beginning of the handmaid tale look like were on a one way trip back to the dark age
"paying to travel to a state where abortion is legal , is still an option . and much cheaper than 18 year of raising a kid . so if you want an abortion , remember the pregnancy wa your mistake , accept the responsibility , fork up the money and stop bitching . by the way i support government provided contraception to all , no government fund for abortion ."
but at least i became a criminal for the right reason
and my kid nobody want to bring her to me nobody want to give it to me and nobody want to tell me whatever this i do n't know what this stupid s * * * is here i do n't know how you guy shit work and since nobody will help me walk her to me something tell me what 's going on i will become a criminal
president trump knew what he wa doing biden is trying to cause conflict with those country no let 's make sure that we unite those country let 's make sure that we unites everything that they wanted to cover up instead of making conflict with those country let 's all get in it together we 're all the minor minority
dont like it then dont get pregnant abortion is murder not birth control for the irresponsible
1:33 what an absolute karen
thank u for allowing comment
not to mention the fact that you got shell corp baby turtle arent they illegal to sell
"`` the hell with scotus , we will defy it '' -maxine water ( d ) ca .... a sitting member of congress said that ! .. i wonder if she remembers some other word she said ... such a `` preserve protect and defend `` ..... imho ... spitting on your oath of office is a high crime and misdemeanor .... these elected criminal which are of this opinion need to simply resign or be impeached .... or simply voted out ! !"
this f * * * * * * administration they are covering up war crime sex trafficking they are covering up an international sex trafficking ring that is being fueled and funded by government agency and office
you kept my kid away from me for three year because you would n't give me my kid cuz you wanted a political insurance hit a surety bond 13 company miller real estate five star because you wanted to cover up your corruption but most of all you want to cover up covidian
"sooo ..... america make abortion illegal because they argue they want to save the life of future child , but yet america doe n't care enough about those child to change gun law so they do n't keep getting shot in school . got it ."
nary a word by mainstream dems about the childrens life in the womb .
i have an email where i believe wa five to seven million dollar at state for a hit on me because it would appease many people in office but they went to a bike to do it they just did n't know the minority is the majority you kidnapped my kid my kid you used because you were too worried about your corruption and your baby sex trafficking well do n't worry you got the right one four and a half year did n't you lock me up send me to prison throw me the mental institution have the police beat me up because you would n't give me my kid
and i thought church and state wa supposed to be seperate in the u.s. ....
republic of gilead here we come .. under his eye .
do n't i have that email
the fact that religious view of some ha had a lot of influence on this massive decision is regrettable
biden you should have did something about this board and you should n't have tried to hit me did n't you use a bike did n't your office administrative level pay five to six thousand million dollar within your administrative level to put a hit on me to shut me up
this is the ugliest thing i 've ever seen and i 've never seen a goddamn administrative level office cover up something what i witness every f * * * * * * day my f * * * * * * kid ha been kidnapped for 4 and 1/2 year because they wanted some goddamn money they wanted a political insurance hit
about time one step foward for conservative
do you know how many men are involved in this sex trafficking ring at the highest level do you know that the southern district mayor of new york authorized for these people and these office these congressional office to sleep with these woman that were an institution and then raped their child and this is all in a book and it is said that if it ever wa to get out it would be politically controversial
the negation of abortion right make me feel a if we 're moving backwards rather than forward
happy day ! ! what a happy day ! ! ! there is absolutely nothing in the actual u constitution that expressly state a person can wholesaley murder a child ! !
my kid are important and all these kid have been extorted sex trafficking thousand thousand of kid that have been killed at the hand of the administration at our border that they have failed to do anything about it
"yeah she hate black people and she know black make up over half of all abortion . since 1973 over 19,000,000 black baby were aborted ... if those 19 million black were allowed to love then reproduce just imagine how many million more black would be in the usa ! ! ! probably enough to make half the population of america black by now ... but deep down these politician and crazy chalky lady dont want more black alive"
family planning resource should prevail .
these woman mad they cant kill baby . just strap up or keep your leg closed . stop being a hoe ! ! !
close your leg and you wo n't need to murder your own baby .
the people have won !
abortion is murder
you cry because you ca n't kill baby anymore f * * * * * * nut
baby killer mad and seething
those pathetic woke liberal have caused this with their gender fluid nonsense meaning that they can no longer define what a woman is ! feel the power of a conservative backlash you whining snowflake ! ! ! !
what president
i 'm happy with the majority of american who are making this happen
keep your leg closed there wo n't be a problem
"in america considering the 63 million of baby that have been killed by early `` termination '' something had to be done , obviously killing baby is not good . and sorry but it appears woman do n't seem to have the education to protect themselves and killing the baby ha become the easy solution , i ca n't believe an american president can speech that killing baby is a right , whatever belief you are , i wish you well and all life on this beautiful planet ."
"back to illegal abortion , at least now there is a chance the aborting woman dy in the process ... 2 fly in 1 ... haha"
"i 'm a woman and am so pissed that these people say abortion is about woman 's right.no , it is not . woman are naturally nurturers , care giver , protector of life not killer ."
"welcome to gilead ,"
"i do n't understand today 's generation .... people have normalised sex and it ha become a way of enjoyment . people nowadays take sex so lightly that it mean nothing at all . if we consider sex a a holy gift of god to be enjoyed by married couple then there wo n't be any issue at all .... abortion is mostly done by people who go around having sex for enjoyment ... in some case , it 's done by rape victim but mostly by people who take sex a a mean of enjoyment .... if you are doing for enjoyment use protection . a condom wo n't cost you much . but for me having sex with multiple partner is not necessary at all ... and sex do n't prove your love for your partner , so say no to sex before marriage .... i am a christian and i truly believe that sex is holy . and the protester here are not victim of rape or medically unfit to have baby .... they are protesting because they want to have sex with multiple partner and in case of pregnancy they want to go for abortion .."
why should a rape victim go through month and month of dealing with a pregnancy that she didnt even want . woman who want kid talk about the struggle of pregnancy but theyre happy because they actually want the child so it a little easier to deal with everything that come with it . a child is a beautiful thing dont get me wrong but for a rape victim theyre not gon na be thinking i have a miracle baby . no woman should ever have to conceive a baby that way . all theyre gon na think about whether they give up the baby or not is the fact that it a rape baby . and then what if it their very first child . idk bout you but i wouldnt want my first child conceived by being a rape victim and forced to take care of it or give it upthats traumatizingjust saying .
thanks for love of life american
good job u . you 're turning theocratic with every passing day .
there wa never a constitutional right to abortion you biased disgusting so called new organisation
"from what i can see , the point that is completely lost in this whole issue is personal responsibility . if you check the number , one percent of abortion are a result of rape and half that for incest , next is medical reason . that leaf irresponsibility for the rest . so , instead of threatening violence for the right to kill an `` unwanted '' baby that you created , how about being responsible with your body and your choice and do n't get pregnant ? not getting pregnant is very easy ."
how dare these people in position of power think they have any right to tell a woman what to do with they own body ! do n't force religious belief on individual war have been caused by foolish people who claim they do thing in god name if abortion is now illegal will every man going to be out in prison for masturbation cuz shit that 's killing thousand of kid every time we orgasm pro life people are blind to the truth they constantly contradict themselves and in outlawing abortion they themselves raised the suicide rate pro life equal pro death smfh
and just like that the democrat know what a woman is !
abortion mean killing/ murder and who support that it is satanic generation ?
"if you do n't want to have baby , do n't have sex . sex wa designed primarily for procreation not for fun ."
still waiting for amrica to go full nazi and invade europe
bbc is another liberal medium which is known for distortion of the truth . first and foremost abortion is not enshrined in the american constitution . secondly the judgement insist that abortion matter are solely state not a federal issue . thirdly the judgement never banned abortion rather is specified a time frame in which abortion are permitted . why is bbc changing the narrative ?
"life won today , indeed ."
"it wa never a constitutional issue .. idiot , it wa a state issue like it is now i wa 15 now im 65 and lost my nephew when i got out of the marine corp cuz my sister in law got one ."
everytime the left open it mouth they vindicate the right position : it is about human right . all human ! ! !
thank your parent for not believing in abortion
satan must be rejoicing right now ! he managed to capture the soul of all of god little lamb . to the so called christian just know that youve been suckered by the devil . these are the same people that would crucify jesus were he to make an appearance today . pathetic ! ! !
"i am a chinese and i am sad to say that in china , we still dont have such law that can prevent u from stopping abortion . i am very happy to see that america walk in the right way and i hope one day in my country abortion can be illegal"
"woman not allowed a choice , black african that turn their back on their own culture and worship a white man 's god . pro lifer that want to keep the right to shoot people . trans men allowed in woman 's sport ."
crazy people upset because they ca n't kill baby anymore .
land of the free ?
"this is one of the stupidest decision america ha made this year . this is a personal issue , why is it politicized ?"
"so many unreasonable adult out there .... instead of wearing a condom , or getting on the pill , or getting a vasectomy , you would rather have an abortion"
snowflake meltdown ... make america great again ! from serbia
"use a condom , or birth control . stop being no , class slut ."
i thought they were supposed to be the `` land for the free '' - do n't seem to free to me ... 1:29 i am very curious to know what `` devastation '' that person is talking about .
from what i can concern these horrible woman can die doing illegal abortion ... that 'll rid u of horrid mind .
we in india ha low rate of abortion
"well , now that abortion is going away , maybe we can start focusing on banning religion next !"
i welcome
will stop illegal sex ..
biden is a sad day for america .
biden is a sad day for america .
let me get this str8 .... it 's ok for parent to kill their child ? and it ok for father to murder their child a well because they came from our ball sack ?
what the fuk have human become ? abortion is murder . no person ha a right to end life no matter what your fukin selfish excuse are .
the news anchor is wrong nowhere in the constitution doe it mention abortion read the constitution and the amendment
liberal always look mentally ill
"enjoy going backwards several 100 year moron ....... enjoy the civil war that becomes a result of this , & what the hell were you thinking religious freak , & you do n't think it prudent to ban gun ........... you 're all just plain old stupid"
abortion is murder unless there is a threat to the mother life or the child wa conceived through incest or rape .
i wonder how many of trump girlfriend or fling he ha given money to to have an abortion ? for shame to all of you that think he is a god fearing man .
land of the free .
taliban country ! next step : girl are n't allowed to go to school .god bless the usa .
woman do have a right to birth control . married or not . to kill an innocent baby just because momma failed to use contraception is not the baby fault . abortion is legalize murder and should be treated a so ....
the biggest killer of woman around the periparturient period is suicide sadly this i think will increase . cant help but feel if this affected men body the result would be different . im glad biden had common sense .
first why do n't they fix the loose gun law usa
and they call themselves champion of human right usa
"excellent news for the humanity , not to the abortion , not to the killing of innocent people , now usa win a moral standard , something that lost 50 year ago about the right to life . the politician supporting the abortion will see the will of the people ."
what are you talking about ? these kid are human being ! they are alive !
why do the right- to-lifers want to protect the unborn ? they are not protecting or giving a better right to life to those born and struggling right now . the conservative have stuck their middle finger up the hornet 's nest one time too many .
reality will dictate whether this judicial ruling will be progress or regress . im just here watching the future .
a poor law ha been dismembered just like the clinic that only exist to chemically poison or dismember unwanted pre born baby
this decision wa made by the federalist society that nominates all republican appointed judge .
"woman 's body ... so let her decide plzz ... if a child is born without her wish ... the baby will go through hardship ... what ever is happening in u is regressive ... in the name of baby murder , you are actually snatching away the right from the parent .... plz put a ban on sex too"
they will not fully celebrate until woman are not allowed to wear pant . biblical theolgy ia taught in school and being gay is made a crime in all 50 state . these people are insane

did the speaker of the house change the bathroom in the white house so the pride man can walk in on her and ask for a kotex or a tampon just another opinion
i wonder how many of those pro lifer have adopted ? million of kid no one want . but well just not mention that
"usa ha very quickly turned into a shithole . child routinely murdered in school by crazy people with assault rifle , black people being assassinated in the street by police officer and woman being treated like second class citizen . if men had to gestate , abortion would be free and available on every street corner . country is a complete joke ."
"if you do n't support abortion , then you support illegal abortion - that is what will happen , you may not like it , but the fact & evidence of history prove it ."
this show how backwards the usa is the right wing there is so hypocritical !
"so much seething in the comment section sorry lady , no more killing your child at your convenience ."
"it self rightious , to pride yourself on the dictatorship of other people 's life ! ! !"

"hm ... i do n't care one way or the other , really , but dropping roe doe n't seem like such a huge deal to me . if you have so little personal responsibility that you ca n't keep from getting accidentally pregnant , just move to a state where the revolving door at the local abortion clinic is still open -- easy fix ."
"i noticed generally that no one is discussing the actual case , which i find a bit odd . the draft opinion say regarding roe : it relied on an erroneous historical narrative ; it devoted great attention to and presumably relied on matter that have no bearing on the meaning of the constitution ; it disregarded the fundamental difference between the precedent on which it relied and the question before the court ; it concocted an elaborate set of rule , with different restriction for each trimester of pregnancy , but it did not explain how this veritable code could be teased out of anything in the constitution , the his- tory of abortion law , prior precedent , or any other cited source ; and it most important rule ( that state can not pro- tect fetal life prior to viability ) wa never raised by any party and ha never been plausibly explained . roe and casey represent an error that can not be allowed to stand . no one discussing the actual decision . there is no right to abortion in the constitution . it not a constitutional right . the decision is logical . it make sense . we cant just project law onto legal document that arent there ."
"i 'm confused usa sent amry to war , to protect dictatorship , to protect woman , yet you 've just done what islamic state is , you pro life but yet your law also state you can legally make a woman be sterilized , it 's a total disgrace"

pro-choice people can protest the u supreme court decision on banning abortion all they want & until theyre blue in the face but the highest law maker in land made their decision it final and it now carved in a granite stone slab and no one could change it so it best for everyone to accept & honor it it instead of fighting it .
this happened in ethiopia
it easy dont shag or use prophylactic 's .
looney left medium doe not report all the fact . abortion law will be left up to individual state . california and new york it will be abortion a usual . nothing will change . read the united state constitution before you report . no amendment on abortion right shall not be infringed upon .
there are other way to deal with unwanted pregnancy than to kill a baby ! killing is not the answer ! killing is not the answer !
"glory be to god , the victory is the lord . any female who want to get a botched abortion deserves to die a they try to kill a defenseless baby , hoping they get caught and all who partake in it , go to prison you evil murderer . just remember god always win and you will reap what you sow ."

a rare w for america
"year from now people will be denying they ever supported mass abortion death and stealing credit of it defeat from christian movement , just like with abolition and alcohol regulation ."
the only reason a woman would be against abortion is because she wa brainwashed by religion . i just can not see how that make any sense whatsoever ..
"sarah smith say the court 's decision , which she ha obviously never read , is `` radical . '' if anything , roe wa the `` radical '' decision . it propagated bald-faced lie about what is in the constitution because seven male justice wanted to pas their policy off a part of our basic law . the dobbs decision is a simple retreat from that fraud . during it five decade , roe wa never accepted by a unanimous supreme court , it wa partly overturned in 1992 , and the only thing shocking now is that three justice still claim it is partly sound ."
use condom and birth control your liberal idiot
what god do you serve ? god is against abortion !
pro lifer want you to have the kid at any cost but you better not ask for social support service after the kid come .
maybe a pro abortion woman should be called a mummy .

it amazing that human who are alive can support abortion a if they fell from the sky . imagine if those who support abortion were aborted .
i dont know much about u culture but if abortion is legalised for medical reason if mother 's life is in danger and not for woman who cant keep their leg together and act responsibly then it should not be a problem .
'right to abortion struck down ... ' that 's one way of putting it . but how about 'right to life for baby upheld .. ' ?
a a society interest it 's better not doing abortion but a individual it 's high cost - unless we start to be more care for our action and the government will help u and close the gap
are those woman cry because they ca n't murder baby anymore ? ( disgusting human being ) .
teach young woman to protect themselves if they do n't want killing baby is not a choice is murdered .
this is a great news . acknowledging the sanctity of life .
"government are all for abortion so they will overturn this , give it a few month . it just gon na have woman feel more accepting of it when they bring it back . leading to more abortion than ever before ! shocking political tactic going on ! ! dumb shit"
"many way to avoid child get your tube tide , or use a condom . killing a human is not a choice is murdered ."
no abortion i agree 1million percent and i hope it happens all across america.too all the fool protesting here you are marching the street because you were not aborted even if life growing up wa tough still here you are alive and well enough to march for killing an innocent child.if you woman marching do n't want child then remove your womb and become a condom.no abortion is correct and jail time to the people causing these crime .
"abortion is bad ! protect your sex , if you do not want kid ."
"abortion being banned in half the state , the same state who wo n't pas better gun control law . so they 're for life unless it 's taken by a gun ."
abortion should n't be illegal
it 's hilarious to watch all these baby murder getting upset and also do n't forget to do your peaceful protest
clear to see who side the bbc is on
we are devo
forcing a woman to have a child is wrong but i do n't agree to kill innocent baby

"and you guy wonder why , the rest of the world , think your system are retarded"
"horrible . i feel sorry for woman who are raped and forced to give birth , those who have a fetus with handicap , etc ... i am so stunned that woman are pro with this crap . mind blowing . those saint mary look alike , religious fanatic woman will regret it one day ."
these idiot woman will never win .the law have thec duty to protect the baby if you were not rape .
"maybe contraception would be a better option than a vile abortion .my body my choice no that s gone ever since the vaccine green pas , when their wa no choice for those who wanted a choice ."
implement consequence for people who are making these unwanted child over and over and maybe they 'll respect sex more . i fostered a little girl who wa her mother 's 7th unwanted baby . i believe she need a forced hysterectomy .
"good . why should judge make law ? in a democracy , the people elected by the voter should make law . but the truth is that our elite do n't want that : they consider the general population to be too stupid to make these decision ."
pro-choice should have a option of getting cab just like animal so they wont reproduce thats the biggest worry

simple thing to deal with . let every state to decide if it is ok ! this kind of thing can never be an issue in china and can not image why it is so tricky in usa
"shame on the supreme court . a panel of 7 men should have never had the right to vote . not you 're body not your choice . lady , if you need an abortion , i hear canada welcome you to visit . they believe in woman 's right ."
i 'm sorry but what bloody right doe a bunch of men and old at that have to tell woman what they can and ca n't do with their body .. communism here we come .. how blind can people be ..
"this is what religion brings to your doorstep - war , destruction , segregation , authoritarian rule , dogma , just evil overall . note that this entire thing wa brought on , not by muslim , or hindu or atheist .it wa the christian ! christian did this . welcome to christianity ."
what a misleading title . it doe not `` strike '' down abortion right . it simply say that it is not constitutional and give it back to the democratic legislature . it 's a true pro democratic decision .
"america , what a shit hole ."
kinda sad when religion basically rule your country like in country such a afghanistan or back in the medieval age .
misleading title . they actually kicked the abortion decision back to the state .
"the headline should read `` right to murder struck down by u supreme court '' . this isa a very welcome and humane decision ! ! ! the mass slaughter of baby must stop ! ! ! roe v wade wa an evil , anti-human , pro-nazi , pro-infantacide , pro-genocide and satanic decision ! ! ! to see femin-nazi 's cry in our street because the court have restricted their right to murder ! ! ! is a sickening sight ! ! ! their mendacity is incredible ! ! !"
really this is a slap on the face of woman all over the world .
to bad for the baby killer .
if you 're like me you 're scrolling the comment for the word `` spock ear . ''
if woman stop having sex . will that put their life in danger ? nope . plus they wo n't kill a new life . there you go . sex is for married male husband and his female wife anyway - mark 10:6-9
right to abortion is like the right to murder
it 's all about there life all about them self and useing the word of it my `` body '' .. guess what britches god is fighting back for the right of baby 's .. co they are people too only little one .
the republican are such hypocrite it sickening . this decision ( ironically ) ha nothing to do with life . these people voted for trump which clearly say they are not playing with a full deck of card . this decision ha set america back.and more is to come . these republican may not be that bright but the combination of power and ignorance left in their hand is entirely dangerous for this country .
amazing ! ! this is going to save million of baby
it 's still legal ... stop freaking out
jeez i seriously hope god doesnt condone this stuff
killing baby is not a right lady ! what woman ha a right to murder baby !
"i do n't really understand why most ppl seem to be against it . even though there 's still 15 week for ppl to decide whether they want the baby or not . it 's not 15 day , it 's 15 week , almost 4 month . the baby would grow up to human shape and be able to move inside the uterus . how could anyone even consider doing such horrible thing ? if you really have difficulty raising child , use protection . if it 's an accident , hey you still have like 3 month to decide starting from tje late period . if anyone consider himself/herself a human being , start to act like one . instead of shouting for the 'freedom ' that you wa n't supposed to have a a human being ."
"pretty obvious that brit do not understand our constitution . since abortion is not mentioned in the constitution it is not one of the enumerated power granted to the federal government . therefore , under the 10th amendment abortion fall `` to the state or to the people '' . this ruling is actually more democratic that the arbitrary dictate imposed by roe v wade ."
"they could at least have made exception for victim of sexual abuse , incest , and when doctor know there is like 90 % chance of down syndrome . but honestly i am not so sure normal healthy pregnant woman should have a right to free surgery for a self inflicted condition that pose no health risk . how can killing a healthy fetus be part of the hippocratic oath of treating the ill and doing no harm ? if a woman have a right to an abortion a doctor should also have the right to say no , id rather spend my precious time treating cancer and bullet wound than perform unnecessary surgery on the healthy ."
thank god thank you for delivering little baby 's from the hand 's of monster
human right should include all human . and for those who would dehumanize the unborn ... you 're one step closer to being dehumanized by others who think you have no value .
i dont see them adopting any new born they just want live baby so they can have dead aoilders
doe bbc and it audience understand that the united state is a federation of state and what that mean in light of the 9th and 10th amendment to it constitution ?
"once i wa pro choice , a i become older however , i became aware how precious the life is . i saw the people dying in combat , i saw the people dying in this pandemic covid-19 , especially youngone that they can not help themselves . i realized that life is precious and is given only once , and need live it to the fullest . in that regard , i rethought of the value of life , that everyone , even unborn human being called fetus ha right to live , and giving a choice to them to choose to live or die , that is the true pro choice . i am now pro life . i have message for pro choice woman and if one is against unwanted pregnancy , first and foremost use caution in mating , and if that did not work or wa in a situation , it ca n't be exercised , consider adoption rather than killing a baby unborn child . yes we need change the law but not the legalizing a murder . in that regard , we need make it easier for mother with unwanted child ( and up to child under 5 ) to put up for an adoption and make it more easier in general adoption . that is responsibility of law maker , up until now law maker ; they choose easy way out by legalizing murder . now they need gather and go to work ."
anyone else noticed that the two woman at the beginning are one that no man would ever be physical with
so glad trump decided to elect those three judge ! # lifewins # adoptionsaveslives # babylivesmatter oh and by the way .. with great pleasure come great responsibility !
"i m from brazil where abortion is prohibited since always thousand of woman do illegal abortion without safety or healthy care , thousads are arrested more than 50 thousand a year . brazilian press never talk about this subject something like `` dont ask dont tell '' . the problem is not going to disappear woman will keep seeking abortion too much hipocrisy and religious bullshit.thats a men world we know since early childhood.free woman around the world !"
"this is a strike against woman . period . it 's about power and control , solely . the right to freedom of choice , for anything for woman - let 's be honest , is devastated by this ruling . ugly . gillead in on our doorstep ."
what we will never hear is biden say that something ha gone his way .
what i do n't understand is why are they over turning this . how bad wa it that they need to overturn it ? wa this really a problem now day ?
why doe the law in the usa consider the murder of a pregnant woman a double homicide if an unborn baby is not yet a `` life ? ''
"how many of these woman protesting against abortion will ( or have ) adopt a child from an orphanage ? reality is if woman who can not ( or mentally refuse to ) take care of a child , now that they ca n't make an abortion they 'll just leave the kid . and unfortunately staticaly not a lot of child get adopted and the one who do n't are kicked out of orphanage at the age of 18. unfortunately statistic for these young people is not good . so yes sure protest for life but this decision will lead to a lot of young people having not so good of a life ."
everyone ha the right to move to another state.if abortion is important for you there a a dozen of state that are better suited for you . please respect the court ruling . it wa a democratic decision by a bipartisan elected court .
"oh god . more fact lite partisan bullshit from the bbc . color me surprised reality check : mostly false . the scotus ha ruled that the federal government ha no right to impose this poorly written , unconstitutional law . it 's up to individual state to decide . in california , new york , oregon , alaska you can abort your baby right up to the point of birth . a it head emerges you can cut it off b/c it 's still not human . most u state had law permitting abortion up to 30 week . now they are free from federal control . allowed to set the limit themselves . people can actually vote locally to change those limit . it 's called democracy ."
"i can not understand the government ! in germany it is so , that one may carry out an abortion only then , if since conception ( fertilization ) no more than twelve week have passed . this corresponds to the 14th week of pregnancy . the meaning behind it is , that namely after expiration of this period , the protection of the unborn child take effect and must be ensured . ( according to the federal constitutional court ) now the discussion about the deletion of paragraph 219a of the penal code ( stgb ) which then allows doctor on their website , to advertise for abortion to be allowed to perform , and accordingly . with the new government since 12/2021 in the office is and not from conservative member consists , i am sure the paragraph 219a is abolished . it belongs a i mean , to a liberal society that one may feel freely about it . but it is also due to the principle of protection of the unborn child , a soon a the 14th week of pregnancy pass . this should not be changed . i am happy that we have here , a one of the few country in the world , a `` federal constitutional court '' , which alone ha the right to decide on such morally difficult question . also private person can sue for their right . a the highest court that stand above all court , it judgment is unchallengeable . one talk in germany also of `` residence/city of the right '' or `` there i go up to karlsruhe '' ( in order to assert it right ) ( karlsuhe = name of the city where the court is ) ."
poor people and mentally deranged should not have baby period ... i know this firsthand ... however the const really doe not say anything about abortion so the roe law had no basis ... which is why they reversed it . and now each state will enact their own law which is how it should be ... if u do n't want kid ... 2 option ... close your leg or drive over state line like ca and they will do it for free i imagine so they can take the fetus and do stem cell research on it for their miracle drug .
killing black people is murder . thats why i dont listen to yp . they say abortion is murder but killing black people isnt ?
"the manosphere and their pick-mes must be jumping for joy at this ruling . gone will be those 5 , unholy decade when desirable , fertile woman with better job , better education and more fulfilling and diverse sex life , would run around free in both choice and option , and unburdened with both childcare and deadbeat husband ! because misery sure love company , especially with the chance to pull our said attractive heroine down a peg or two off their pretty perch ! seriously , it 's the jealousy and resentment from the unfulfilled and unhappy people in society who would want to put woman back to biblical time . sheesh"

"i find it funny how even after banning abortion , conservative never had a plan to prevent possible situation where abortion are needed from happening like free contraceptive , more and better sex ed in school , funding family and mother who didnt want a child and cant afford one , improving the foster care and adoption system and making penalty for rape more severe especially if the rape result in an unwanted child"

free cheeseburger day at the court house .
a theocracy just like iran
praise the lord . no more murder .
the number one cause of death worldwide is killing unborn baby that did not have a choice
"this is the greatest verdict ever given by the supreme court in the state . abortion is deplorable because it mean killing . to those who endorse abortion , i would say that you have no right to kill somebody for your own pleasure . that said , the victim of rape and those who have to undergo an abortion on medical ground , have to be exempted from this law ."
so much for the `` land of the free '' .. more b !
hahaha you making me laugh stop westing people time to cover body part stealing crime
if you do not want a baby do not make one if a baby is conceived by violence give the baby up for adoption a rapest doe not get the death penalty
"12-weeks is a good determination point on deciding whether or not to continue the pregnancy . that is the point where the fetus thereafter gain consciousness and the point where a woman is able to ass element like drug addiction , health , social climate or whether her child should be forced to live in dirt poor poverty and low-life quality , etc . now that roe is struck : population will explode in rank of those already poor who are already struggling and/or unable to have basic human need and facing homelessness at it is now , let alone there being any hope of their kid going to college and prospect for anything other than existence ' and being dirt poor and on welfare from birth to death . once upon a time century ago it wa ok to flood the earth with population unchecked and now this population ha wiped out the rain forest and i predict the strain on 'water will be the next ; a human population increased to today 's level god gave abortion to man to remedy & control his number . take a look at the situation with lake mead for instant then 'go ahead and crank out another several million baby beyond the capacity of our planet ."

me and my dad had a long conversation about this last night . he even mentioned it wa a very emotional day at work because of this setback . ( he wa at work when this happened . ) it is very saddening to think that they also might even take away lgbtq right .
"it not your land , it belongs to the native people ."
"no one ha the right to tell a woman what to do with their body . get rid of everything in washington , the are not for the people . dont you get it , this he way beyond abortion right . they are causing chaos so they can get total control ."
the solution is easy . stop voting for the american taliban ( republican ) .
"having a child born or not is the right belongs to the woman because it only affect her health and her life . why do they have to waste time considering that law when there are many other thing that need their attention , thing that affect life of many people ( like gun or petrol ) ?"
how about telling all the woman and girl to stop opening their hairy leg and having sex without protection ? there are consequence of your action .
"responsible sexual contact . in case of crime related case , woman 's life is medically in peril from pregnancy then abortion maybe justified . a offspring ha right to life too ."
"what it mean to follow christ in iran : the iranian government is among the most oppressive regime in the world . it is illegal to leave islam , and christian face the constant threat of imprisonment and being falsely charged with acting against national security for owning bible or even talking about christ . christian are routinely fired from their job , and it is difficult for a known believer to find a job or rent a home . many christian gather in secret fellowship and receive teaching through christian medium smuggled into the country and through broadcast medium . several christian are currently imprisoned , and many others are under house arrest awaiting sentencing . access to bible : it is illegal to own , print , import or distribute bible . since they are so difficult to obtain , bible are treasured by iranian believer . few have their own copy of god word . give bible"
"only 25 % of the american population believe that abortion should be illegal under all circumstance , if any gop member try to do that they will fail miserably"
"the country is riddled with problem like homelessness , drug addiction , and poverty and these sanctimonious judge have no idea how the overturning of roe v wade will impact on the life of million of woman . they 're a bunch of dinosaur , idiot who turn a blind eye to an obviously corrupt ex president and his crony and claim to have god on their side in making this decision . they are bible thumping , heartless and privileged . they did n't need to do this . they did it because they wanted to and because they could . only a woman forced to make a choice when confronted with an unwanted pregnancy can understand the consequence of and bear responsibility for an abortion . it is a personal matter . government should not intervene but give every assistance possible to help woman who find themselves in the position of having to make that choice come to the right decision , do what is best for them . is it harder for a woman to give a baby up for adoption than have an abortion ? perhaps . many wealthy couple in america who have fertility issue will be clapping their hand because there will be more baby available for adoption . for sure there will be a market for discarded offspring . whose interest are being served here ?"
"i do not agree with an abortion ban , nor do i side with feminist who honour an abortion . i am against a blanket ban or a complete authorisation for abortion . aborting a child at the first trimester should be legal , after that should be banned . most of the abortion happens before the 12th week anyways . at the time , the child is not really a child yet , and it give the woman the right to choose . the left and right both have their agenda , which i loath . but this overturning should be expected because it ha no legal ground of that , the state shouldve made legislation in the past ."
i feel sorry for the rape victim and those at medical risk . but the fact that you can just get pregnant and then kill a life that depends on you for survival is wrong .
usa going backwards
the problem ? no problem ... far too many people with far too little to do with far too little education and/or critical analysis skill with far too many glib opinion and untested assumption ... being governed by people with the same credential .

( few pregnancy are the result of rape , which is a different question . )"

"when these child are starving . when these child of suffering from life without parent . when they suffer at the hand of parent who were forced to provide them with life and are nowhere close to ready to have kid . when they are abused by the profiteer of the defenseless ( human trafficker ) . you best believe i will be there to remind you of your abject failure . i will make sure you know that simply living is not life . not for a human being . not for someone who ha the conscience understanding of the hell in which they live . there will now be million that suffer . not just the woman that is raped and you believe that to be by divine province , you sick twisted rat . the people who will suffer are those who will be abandoned not only by their mother but by the society that forced them to live and then blamed them for not being good enough ."

be aware : the lude medium is a traitor of america !
glory to god
this is simple it about the court saying the abortion issue is up to the state . each state shall determine how they want to manage the issue of abortion . if a state want to limit abortion to medical emergency then they have the legal right to do that . if congress want to pas a law concerning abortion then they will need the necessary vote in the house and senate .

your country doe care about you moron 's it just is n't letting people with multi coloured hair tell them what to do .
they love unborn baby a long a they 're not mexican
pregnancy is extremely dangerous for human compared to other mammal . the reason so many woman die from child birth is not the abortion it is because it is quite dangerous for a woman to give birth . and alot of woman do die in child birth even when the child survives .
"if you 're 'pro life ' you should also be a vegan to make sure you 're not contributing to the suffering and murder of innocent animal who are considered life and have nerve like people so they can feel pain . you should also be living off grid in a self sustainable commune so a to make sure you do n't contribute to an economy that relies heavily on the destruction of eco system , not to mention our planet . but no , it 's nothing to do with protecting life , it 's about being a religious nutcase ."
the bbc should be pro or against abortion but the bbc is clearly pro abortion and that is not news it 's pure and simple activism .

"the reality is that this decision is from the supreme court . they are the final arbiter for the entire country . this can not simply be repleaded like a bill in a special session of congress , or a revoked with a executive order . it can only be reversed with another abortion case from the ground up in a local court . in other word it will take year for this to actually change ."
fu * * sake why are these people trying to kill young baby .
the left and democrat do n't like it when it doe n't go there way and they cry about it .
america need to start tackling real problem like affordable housing of which there is none for minimum wage single men . woman only have to have kid and they are set up until the new born is 18 yr old . sort out free hospital like the rest of the civilized world . and make social housing a real thing that is accessable to the homeless . the mentally ill poor and the poorly educated become homeless . it is not only predictable and a should be a human right to a place to sleep . and dont get me started on gun ! holy shit !
enshrined ! ! ? ? ? clearly not ! ! ! ! !
the problem with america is it full of american
quite likely something to do with the right of the child . bbc you need to report news without bias .
america is a broken country
"why do they always focus on the absolute minority ? ie incest , rape etc . the overwhelming majority of woman getting abortion are sleeping wrecklessly with men . they should stop being a slut and get their priority straight ."
all woman in the usa should stop having sex until this law is changed .
this is a woman 's problem and should be left up to the woman and man should ask them self 's if there wife wa giving birth and they where ask it is the wife or the baby 's life which one would they save ?
"sorry but your country is going backwards , when mostly men , and some of them are that old they wouldnt have a clue what sex wa about , decide that it illegal to have abortion then there is something sadly wrong . what a disgrace ."
so they cry and cry when it doe n't go there way but you told if you do n't have the vaccine you 're killing everyone .
choose two method of contraception ? choose to not sleep with anything and everything ? choose life ? lot of choice still out there . where doe it say in the constitution that woman have the right to murder their unborn ?
republican desperately hoping stripping people freedom away will give them some whataboutism ammunition whenever jan 6 is mentioned . the simple fact they dont care about living people prof the concern about the unborn is a lie .
based decision
conservative have blood on there hand
"they pretend to save ( unborn ) life while risking those of the living mother . and once those child are born , all those politician applauding the most now could not care le about the poverty and violence many of these kid will grow up in ... until they get shot at school ."
there is finally a glimmer of hope in america ... murder of innocent baby can never be right

"gun violence , police brutality , gang , corruption , lack of freedom for woman , etc , etc . america is just going backwards unlike here in europe ."
"this is just going to promote more death and hurt for baby . abortion are painless , safe procedure that guess what , kill * nothing * but now woman the victim of rape or incest will be made to carry their child , and those woman might even just murder the baby from the postpartum depression , i mean they would have gotten prosecuted if they got it a an abortion anyway . woman who baby are severely disabled in the womb and wouldnt live more than a few hour are going to have to spend month carrying a child only to hold them in her arm while they feel the pain of failing organ and death , when they could have been given that mercy without the traumatic experience of birth . many woman will die from dangerous pregnancy that they could have survived from by just getting an abortion and living to have another child . this isnt a win for life , this is a win for the continuous suffering of woman and child . these people are disgusting"
"abortion is not now , nor wa it ever , in the constitution stop reporting falsehood bbc nonsense . stick to your own country ... you got plenty of issue to deal with to keep your rating up . thank god for this decision ! state now , a they should , have control , and power back to the people !"
this will not end well !
shut up woman and do a men say .
"jus imagine country in asia allow abortion , usa .. u have lost it .."
where is potato head in all of this ?
you created a child . it not like adopting a puppy and giving it back .
"perhaps this will force people from using abortion a a 'form of contraceptive ' . this ruling of course doe not erode the various exemption for abortion neccesitated by rape , incest and medical emergency . stop reporting this news a though this decision automatically ban all abortion ."
"for the land of the not free , and the home of the insane"
amazing news for good people everywhere .. abortion brings too much darkness .
what is wrong with america ?
allowing abortion is controlling poor mass who lack sexual responsibility .... black and latino i mean democrat will now have large unplanned family which can be exploited by the labour sector by rich white supremacist and also they will provide army for advancing external aggression because of unemployment
time zone are crazy in australia it 9am in in rome it 1am and in america it 1942 .
"the most dangerous place for a child in the u is the womb . all this ridiculous fighting , it a woman right ."
right to life won right to kill innocent
i 've seen left wing activist protesting in manchester england to protect woman 's right to kill a baby . they 're so concerned about it they even protest for woman in another country to kill a baby . yet at the same time they ca n't or wo n't tell you what a woman is . ? ? ? ? ?
history repeat itself .. a someone whom studied history we are a powder keg .. once there is a spark .. itll get ugly .
i hope the religious freak who forced this are prepared to raise those child . i wonder if america ha gone down the shithole so much it will present each newborn with a gun .
production for adrenochrome and demand for fetal material will be in a crisis . this is more than a woman 's right this is a challenge to big business . i guess when they start to abort a fully formed child at term even god himself had to step in .
they 're alive so they are n't in position of talk about abortion let the aborted baby tell about it
"pro-life ? i hope they 're willing to look after unwanted child , and not just take joy in seeing people suffer for their mistake ."

"vile backwards self-entitled country devoid of value and a scar upon history , yet with the pomposity to think they 've a right or a moral position from which to judge the rest of the world and lecture it on human right and democracy . your country employ torture , you consider other people 's body your right and there are more of you incarcerated than any other population on earth . you experiment on your own people ( mk ultra ) treat black people , minority and immigrant like dirt , you make health unattainable for many of your people and you probably have the most crooked , profiteering health system in at least the developed world , many of you still fly a flag of slavery , the kkk have been allowed to persist , the majority wo n't even consider the slightest of gun law change and if i wanted to get shot i 'd think first warzone , then america , and you have caused nothing but misery , woe and destruction around the world . you also elected an illiterate , narcissistic ableist , racist who incited an act of terror , but of course we wo n't call it that because he 's white and claim to be christian , which by the way you force down everyone 's throat and use to signal virtue , even though most pretend commandment 2 , 3 , 4 and 10 do n't exist . that is who you are america , so stop strutting around pretending to have a morsel of moral integrity or authority ; it is baseless ."

"jesus love the little child , a the clueless are singing here , except those that were apparently saved from abortion now having to grow up with easily preventable trauma . love the little child except those who had to deal with being raped and now forced to birth a child that will only cause them more trauma to themselves and that child baby will also have to deal with trauma growing up . and no , adoption is not an option that should be a default . every child in the adoption system deal with trauma regardless of the age they were put into it ( yes , including if they were a newborn ) . it is not an option to easily default to ."

"i understand extreme case for abortion and agree with them but what about the hundred of thousand of woman globally . that basically use abortion a another form of contraception , . no thought or responsibility for your action ? . this is what we really need to be speaking about in society . a for biden and the dems . this wa the guy and party , that wa supposed to unify the usa . how 's that working out joe ? your political and ideological rhetoric , ha over half of your population convinced some form of civil war is coming . cessation of state from the union is definitely on the horizon . the show trial that is jan 6th . the dems using the doj/fbi to persecute your political adversary an in doing so , demonise about a third of your population . hitler did this during the 1930 's and we all know how that turned out ."
"im a christian woman who is 21 week pregnant and just because i have moral biblical belief , that doesnt mean my belief need to be forced upon others ! the u is not a christian country built upon tyranny ! that ha been completely forgotten ! the best part about the u is/was religious freedom for all . well not anymore ! we are literally in babylon now . jesus is about free-will , choice , love , forgiveness of sin , mercy and treating others how youd want to be treated . god never , ever force others to obey his commandment . he always give people the choice to choose . it is satan himself that force people to bow to him and to conform to his twisted will ."

america is an interesting country ! u protecting fetus but not kid who are already born with mad parent transitioning them at young a 2 year old ? these are the kid that need the most protection !
why are woman fighting so hard to kill baby ? ? ? ? baby have the right to live . it 's not your choice to commit murder on baby . disgusted by all these woman . learn to use a condom or keep your leg closed .
youd think they enjoy killing baby with the way they 're going on about it .
i guess this sort of thing can only happen in america ...

'' why is it that most of the people who are against abortion are people you would n't want to fuck in the first place ? '' - george carlin
that is only half my mind on that . im so glad i married a real woman . my wife ha had 6 embryo that are still alive and expressing life . every embryo even one cell of living human should be able to choose their way of life a god intended . no one should judge condemning to death those who are unable to defend themselves . the end result of every non molested embryo ha been a living soul .

"these stupid gullible woman that think god is real and voting to ban abortion , are they trying to say if they were raped by some disgusting evil ugly man that they would willingly have that baby and love it and they would not look at that child and be reminded of what happened every minute of the day for the rest of their life bullshit and the leader of these group deserve it happening to them then see them run to the nearest abortion clinic a nobody want anything to do with them after being raped pregnant and happy about it . this is a sick law and anyone agreeing with it is a mindless sick individual ."
taking away right from people that have had those right for more then 50 year will not go well ! then threatening to take away more right will absolutely guarantee that you wo n't live in a happy country no matter which side you 're on ! taking away right against the wish of a large majority and doing it in the name of god by a financial right wing of catholic judge will only turn million more against the church . that will get even worse and unrepairable when woman start dying ! add this to their ruling that anyone can carry a concealed hand gun in new york city and congress still allowing 18 year old to buy assault rifle and it 's the beginning of a dying country .
if woman have the right to abortion . man should have the right to deny alimony
"they seem to think a woman is simply nothing but a carrier for the next human life that is to appear upon the face of this earth , therefore a female who is raped or ha been incested her feeling is not consider the people making these law against abortion right are no different from those in other place giving order for the clitoris of woman and girl to be cut out !"
"i am pro-life . it is good news . yes , abortion is a murder ."
"if you want an abortion , go to a state it legal they wont be checking your abortion paper like they do with the covid paper ! bafoooooons"
"6:08 - why did her boyfriend beating her & raping her everyday , a you say ? should n't that had been address with a call to the police or the girl calling her parent before becoming an unwanted pregnancy ? now that some how justifies another really bad decision in taking a baby life ? there are 3 time more abortion then rape every year and we also know that only a small percentage of those get pregnant . which mean majority of the woman are using `` killing a baby '' a birth control . oopsy , c'mon people ."
"i hope they stop unwanted pregnancy with easier access to contraception . if they do n't want to stop unwanted pregnancy , then stopping abortion is an unbearable or even fatal decision towards the mother . and could be torture to the baby who wa conceived through incest ."
all that 's happened is they have given the right back to the people instead of the government ...... if it 's illegal in your state vote in pro abortion leader simple no one ha lost anything the blue state can still do what they want the red state will do what they want
america is suc .
well we clearly know on which side bbc is

the dems have n't been this mad since they had their slave taken away from them ...
million of woman in the u losing their right ... to kill their baby . or we could say ... million of baby are gaining their right to live life .
this is the most amazing moment of my life tear of joy ! england will be next i would say hopefully but it a fact !
"welcome to civilization , american ."
this wasnt the least bit biased
can not ignore science and religion ! probably the only time religion and science actually agreed with each other .
wtf america ? ! ?
"there is no future , no equality , no democracy without abortion . god doe not agree with these fanatic and corrupt republican . poor and abused woman will pay the price for this unfounded extremism . woman who are pro lifer are completely illusional . it is disgusting how evil they are . the scotus are putin puppet , sacrificing the life of woman , not saving anyone . and evangelist are evil and ignore the bible . they do n't follow the most important christian law : do n't judge others . and the unborn child is called a `` fruit '' for a reason . it is very clear in the bible that abortion is not murder ."
why get pregnant in the first place
celebrate .... lord himself walk with you pro life
good decision by usa court
it look like america ha lost it in more way than one with this court ruling i am afraid . over population ha consequence just be ware ! ! ! ! !
"mother , who murder their child . how about the child 's right . because they ca n't speak then they have no right ! ! ! ."
body part from tiny live human have been sold to evil monster by evil monsters.how many people even care ?
"these people need to check out nde ..... and what happens to people in the spirit world .... who have abortion . anyone with half a brain realises that : you should not be killing baby . people think they can do what they want on this earth .... then that 's the end ..... they are in for one big shock at death . some nde expreiencers report seeing mile upon mile of pod like object in hell , each one containing a spirit being tortured . another person saw a cave with million of spirit crammed in the dark .... screaming , weeping and wailing ..... an angel nearly 8 foot tall told them : not to step back in there , or your be in there for eternity . other people report seeing a lake of fire 15 mile in radius , and spirit burning inside the volcanic flame . another who , s lifestyle revolved around alcohol , wa told : this is where we send people with your lifestyle when you die ..... and he wa in a moon like landscape being attacked by demonic creature . no one know for certain if it is true ..... but , what if it is ..... and you are sent to a dreadful place for eternity ? it certainly make one think ..... and don , t forget : we are floating on a huge globe in the middle of space ..... so anything is possible ."
burn the bbc to the grow
9 unelected people thinking they have the right to radically regress a country . land of the free
people should be more careful and use condom
"woman have the right over their own body and when one ( male ) take advantage of that , the woman ha to carry and so this is emotionally , and mentally , and physically demanding to a woman and so they make the decision for their health to have the bubble break and be removed . woman did not consent to having their body invaded . men do not understand the depth of making this decision and if male had made this decision over woman , then stand fast lady and fight a global fight . woman understand woman . so do n't allow them to tell you what to do . the organisation and court are private corporation and so you a living woman do not consent and you do not have to accept any ruling which is just an act to overturn it by private corporation . federal and state are private corporation ."
"abortion is ungodly , life matter"
"this judgement suggest , result of political bias for appointment in judiciary . surprisingly there are no check while appointing top post in judiciary . if it 's about right of unborn life , what about right of born woman ? doe woman have any right over her body ? doe n't repeated pregnancy hamper woman body ? why should she be prohibited from natural sex ?"
joe is just woke up ! ! who woke him up ? ? ? just let him sleep forever .....
hallelujah ! ! ! the unborn have the right to life !
if you can not afford buying condom you should not having sex ! ! ! take care of your pusssssy ! ! ! !
handmaid tale in real
good . were amidst a huge demographic crisis and humanity o dying . we need people .
america hate itself !
this is the reaction to people pushing to allow abortion up to one day before birth
take your as to a state that allows it . state right `` live free or die ''
"thank god i dont live in the u.s.a. banned abortion , school shooting , ku klux clan ... i 'd be afraid to walk on the street without loosing my life ."
"say goodbye to your hipaa right to privacy , ivf , contraceptive , surgery to stop an ectopic pregnancy ."
"signing a law that make no exception for rape victim ? . so , they expect a rape victim to carry and birth a child they never wanted in the first place . what about the victim ? who care ? no-one by the sound of it !"
"russian are just watching , they cant belive how hipocratic wst is ."
hooooly shit . i 've long said the u is a moral and intellectual third world country but i did n't expect this . america is so deeply fucked up .
"gun , political fracturing , healthcare , .... this ! ! america fully on it way to being a failed state ."
ohhh noooo it not legal to kill unborn child
"i salute the supreme court , this the happiest day"
"i predict this will result in a brain drain . woman who can will flee , while others will suffer . an increase in crime rate and maternal mortality . increase in violence against woman . the problem with absolute ideal is that tend to be bloody ."
"a dark day for humanity . no one ha the right too tell woman what to do with their body . this is disgusting . the far right christian who endorse this are the scourge of humanity . you have no right ! your god is a sick narcissist , my god is caring and compassionate . the christian movement are no different to a cartel . your `` religion '' is a tool of control , not compassion !"
ive noticed that everyone who is for abortion ha already been born . ronald reagan .
roasties furious that they have to take responsibility for their degenerate behaviour .
adultery and formication should also have punishable result to limit woman getting pregnant in the first placeits not rocket science
"ok to all you pro lifer . let me give you a little analogy . i am a woman of which ha an abusive and violent husband . one night my husband come into the bedroom yelling and screaming at me because i forgot to do something . he then proceeds to rape and violate my privacy . a few week pas by and something doesent feel right and i discover i 'm pregnant with my violent and abusive husband 's child . now let 's say that this ban ha been put into place . i should be forced to endure a 9 month nightmare carrying the child of someone i am begging to get away from and throughout the pregnancy he still continues to be violent and invasive . one night , i go into labour and i am rushed to the hospital and thing arent looking good . my blood pressure is through the roof , i 'm passing out every few minuet and waking up screaming in pain . i come close to death itself . i then have to raise that child whilst their father continues to abuse me and possibly my child which can cause trauma in that child 's life or teach the child that it 's ok to hurt people . they then grow up to be a violent person and cause more crime in america . should i still have to have that baby ? let me add that even when this ban come into place , people are still going to have an abortion ! they are gon na resort to the illegal , unsafe and possibly deadly form of abortion because to bring that child into the world will bring them an unholy amount of trauma . so whats the point ! let me give you another example of why this ban is pointless . murder , is what you call abortion , well murder is illegal everywhere it banned but people still do it . your argument are unbelievably invalid ! you argue that a clump of cell is life and it 's wrong to do so . well everything is a clump of cell and you 've probably stepped on an ant or some form of insect . you destroyed that life why limit it for human ."
report the truth i know it hard for you lot at the bbc
and retardation in the west just grows and grows a time go by
"yes this is good news for u , now all the country of the world should do the same , abortion is murder and tho that are fighting for abortion are also murderer ."
bbc is fake news
great news for the right of those have been murdered ( baby ) because of the careless action ( woman and men ) in getting pregnant outside of marriage leading to conceiving and termination of a innocent child to be ..
"this is such bullshit , it not health care , it killing baby , let be honest ."
"a the one lady said , you ca n't disinvent something . all it mean is that woman will have to travel or alternatively seek a back street quack . someone stated that the judge are there to interpret the constitution , written in 1796 i believe . surely it time to rip up that worthless piece of paper . it like trying to run a modern car on the old diagram and note on a steam engine ."
hallelujah praise the lord !
"antinatalism is the solution in this crowded and crazy world today . i cant believe people keep reproducing while life is getting harder and harder every day . you know life is a nonstop suffering and torment yet you still bringing new child into this cruel , cruel world so they can experience the same like you . how ignorant and selfish you are . human being are so pathetic . i hope global warming brings an unprecedented catastrophe to destroy this planet along with human civilisation and it unfair economic system ."
"it amazing that joe biden , nancy pelosi and their ilk now all of a sudden know what a woman is amazing . abortion shouldnt be used a contraception . thats what the issue is from what i can see . abortion isnt banned . woman ( they do exist . and im no biologist ) can still go to state who will allow it from what joe biden ha said . so not banned at all . more b from msm and the screaming loon in fear for their life ( ! ! ! ) ."
"my body my choice , except when youre forced to take an injection against your will"
mad how some american seem to be so deluded taking away the choice of woman because pro life but when there mass shooting every other day doe nothing about gun legislation ..
the u is becoming more like afghanistan every day .
she 's 21 and 'terrified . ' then keep your panty on and imagine the terror of being murdered .
anybody can have it ... but not everybody should pay for it ... abortion is immoral
let 's abort the baby killer . jihad against child killer
"let make this a bit more transparent . the supreme court in the usa deal with the constitution , they are custodian and there to uphold it . they have deemed , after retrospectively looking into roe v wade , which wa a controversial decision at the time , is in fact not a constutional right - nowhere in the constitution doe it state , or be interpretated , that a woman ha a constituional right to abortion . this will mean that indiviudual state will have the right to make their own law around abortion - some may ban it outright , while others will allow abortion up to 40 week - a governor are elected they are directly accountable to the people . more conservative state will probably have stricter law whilst liberal state will not - but would probably be inline with the will of the people of said state ."
"there is no constitutional riggt to abortion , a abirtion wa not even mentioned in the constitution . the decision simply mean that each state ha the right to democratically decide whether or not to allow abortion on demand . a for joe biden , he professes to be a catholic . by supporting the killing of baby in the womb , he ha shown he is not ."
absolutely disgusting ! thank you conservative and religious christian foundamentalist ! telling woman what they are allowed to do with their body and life : absolutely disgusting ! ! !
well load of people are out of a job now
yo supreme court ban gun that kill both adult and kid
america is the most backwards first world country in the world
i think now only 2 thing that supreme court must make it ilegal 1. gun 2. same sex marrige
great day for state 's right .
liberal melt down loving it defundthebbc
i actually agree with the decision . life over death
this is like trump 's booby trap he left after leaving office . what a sad legacy from a selfish man .
"usa is going backwards , this is so disappointing ."
"knuckle head seems there are no freedom any more , but there are plenty of country outside of the usa that one could easily travel to these day"
the last time pelosi had a period it wa in the triassic ! ! !
the legal murderer need to find a new job . vile criminal
"wtf this 2022 anything could happen pandemic , ban on abortion , alien and world war ."
if a country mandate vaccination then making abortion illegal is n't a surprise because both are done in the belief of doing the right thing even though everyone may not agree
"victory for the innocent , unborn child . if you do n't want to have child , keep your leg closed ."
republican when they get majority they get thing done look at roe v wade now when the democrat get majority they just talk talk look at gun ban
the bbc open with lie .. it only mean very late abortive crime ..
criminalizing pain relief is what it is . ridiculous .
haha all the baby killer lost today .....
the word right and abortion should not be used in the same sentence with a straight face
i wonder if all the woman celebrating anti abortion would feel the same if they got raped on their way home and fell pregnant .
"this is horrendous news , i 'm so sorry my lovely . come to australia .. you 'll have more right , better healthcare and best of all .. no gun"
"hehe , do you notice most anti-abortion activity are fat and urgly ."
"do these people realize the child abandoned because their parent literally could n't afford to feed them , have to go somewhere death is the greatest gift a man can achieve , and not being born in the first place is even more of a blessing"
the uk monarchy encourages abortion through the vile nh . they and my non muslim mother who ironically work for the nh forced myself when i wa most vulnerable before i reverted to islam . witch
america please bring back all of god law
typical disingenuous bbc i see
well it 's far from perfect here but compared to the usa it paradise here .
40 % of uk abortion are to someone who ha already had one . that 's quite careless to have been `` rape or incest '' impregnated at least twice .
i 'm hoping to see riot .
"it ok , calm down everybody the evil democrat will have baby kill centre in all the state that ignore this ruling ."
"ca n't we human strike a balance ... when it should be done and when not . if it is life threatening for mother then existing life should get preference over life yet not born . other extreme is girl take relationship so casual that every second month there is a b.f dumped and a baby that is bad and must be stopped . law must distinguish between extreme . better is to apply and get permission from court before abortion . however no one can stop emergency abortion , it will continue a per existing situation ( pragnent woman meeting accident may need immediate abortion even before her other surgery is performed ) . what about rape victim ? i do n't know how people on such big position try to apply a broad brush ..."
usa : mass shooting at school solution is to ban woman who get sexually assaulted from getting rid of an unwanted pregnancy . got ta fill the school up for the next shooter
time to disband the usa
"* abortion is murder , if you do n't want the baby give it up for adoption . *"
"the protester said this will lead to botched abortion and many woman will die ... well if she is willing to kill her baby .. then what is the problem , could it be a life for a life at all ..."
the first city to be distroyed . is new york city . { russia ) .
wow the u is so backwards
america really is a massive cesspit
so victory is taking away a woman 's right over her own body that 's not victory that 's overbearing control when that child grows up and kill somebody whine up in prison or wind up on disability run our country girl broke then tell me
legalised murder by the state ha n't been banned it ha been put back for the people to decide in individual state which is where this decision should be ! with the people ! this perfectly highlight the left to a t. when they ca n't get enough people to vote for something they turn to the politicised court to get their demand met by either banning it or allowing it . when president trump told people they should peacefully protest at the white house they demanded he wa charged with trying to foment insurrection yet listen to the open and clear threat of violence to come from the left and the sitting president and you get silence
i just do n't understand why woman want to kill their baby ? can someone explain ?
glory !
"i would just stop having sex all together . let the blue balled men overthrow those out of touch geezer . oh , i hope that there will be huge riot . what a shit show"
he will rot in he'll '' '' '' '' ''
"it crazy to me that , united state doesnt have free healthcare , free education , free child care , or free birth control and yet they want to ban abortion ?"
a backward-arsed country in so many respect but this and their inablility to act on gun just ice that cake .
"devastation that abortion brought on u ? if you want to save the child , you should stop gun ! this is ridiculous , youre making it more dangerous for all the woman that will go through abortion in some illegal clinic . america is not being progressive example to the world anymore , more like back tracking into dark day . the best is that men are voting what will happen to a woman body ! ? ! im sorry for the woman , sad time"
"well done america , taking a life a a method of contraception in order to live a hedonistic lifestyle is never acceptable ."
god bless america and to the unborn
i find it atrocious i really do
"i would n't actually mind people revisiting the idea of gay marriage . people tend to forget that developed nation were doing pretty well without it . in fact , it 's in diametric opposition to another protected characteristic ; that of faith ."
when you law and country is built on the bible do n't expect it to just stop these people are bat shit crazy this is why china is taking over from the usa
they have struck down the right to kill another human being . praise be the lord !
"when the beeb and the rest of their pal want you looking at this . just know something else is being done far worse to the people without them knowing it , yet ."
"what a rag tag mob . not a normal person to be seen . lezers , fat ugly enforced celibate , woman without womb and men without winkle , day release mentalists , vegan with secret sausage fetish and finally the lush pelosi and her alcoholic husband ."
protesting because you want the right to murder ? i give up
"the ruling on abortion wa given back to the state to decide for their own . thats it . no one banned a thing . the right to abortion lie with each individual american state . jesus christ . how dumb are you lot . these comment are embarrassing . go read the ruling for yourself . you cant trust these liar . they just whip your emotion by not telling you the truth . right to abortion struck downwow . more like right to abortion decentralised from man in government back to state , back to local opinion ."
"an innocent child doesnt deserve to die because of the action of the abusive father , who would beat the mother . let help the woman in these situation find safety , treat them with love and compassion . killing her child is another violent act towards her . let work towards a nation that serf woman and child and family in need . there is a lot of work to be done . let fix the foster care system and the adoption system . let fix our family leave so woman can have up to a year or two with their newborn . so much need to be done this is the beginning ."
the result of dts nominating of supreme court member ..
what 's the difference urhcraine killing or abortion .
"people need to go home and get on with their life all this judgement of vulnerable people by people with nothing better to do is ridiculous , rape and incest are n't a problem but abortion is apparently"
"you 're lying : the overturn simply mean that it is up to individual state to decide what their stance is , and not the federal government ."
the world is fucked
usa supreme court is right
a lot of baby conceived by rape and incest will be born from yoke to prison and warped life . only religion can take a woman right over their own body .
now every other country need to tell america where to go when they come all holy telling others how to run their country and talking about democracy they are in no position to speak about human right violation when they are eroding every trace of human right in their messed up country . people need to be very careful who they vote into position of power bcoz it ha longterm consequence trumpism and evil satanic ppl strike again . the leader of the dysfunctional state of madmerica seem to want to control people life .. telling them when to eat and when to sleep . these ppl are barberic and evil throughout history and unfortunately time doesnt change people who were taught to be evil to the core from a tender age .
i find it funny how none of the comment on here mention the right of the baby
about time america had some good news . it 's been incessant evil for a long time
"imagine thinking you could keep pushing for later and later abortion , even some saying after birth termination should be the mother 's choice , wanting all that power over another life without responsibility , changing the term from rare case like aborting the product of rape/incest to an on-demand and at any time service , and not expect there to be pushback . the pro-life movement is majority woman by the way , so abortionist can keep trying to blame men , it wo n't stick , especially when an on-demand abortion culture benefit men ."
baby killer unite . the most dangerous place for a black man is in the womb ( source unknown ) .
the news is a big part of causing violence . supreme court did not strike down any right to abortion . they gave it back to the state .
good decision before '' american blood '' go extinct .
another proof of the state being a third world country
and return to back street abortion . well done america .
great day for america
land of the free
"these protester should practice and preach , contraception , instead of murder for a better world . god gave woman the responsibility of the continuation of the human race . do not abuse that sacred right . life is a precious gift . preach to your son and men the against sexual exploitation and trafficking of human . preach to them against greed of money and power being the root of all evil . preach about egalitarianism for a better work ."
why doe this remind me of breeding grouse for those with gun to shoot them
the right to abortion wa given to the people of the state to decide . why lie ?
i despise these religious moron who oppose there b on to everyone else . america is the land of the free . please !
"it 's devastating . abortion wo n't stop , only safe one will . people who think this will save more life are complete idiot ."
i 've noticed that everybody that is for abortion ha already been born . '' president ronald reagan
there 's so much emotion in the rally that it will rip any man masculinity .
"i wonder if sunday church will soon become mandated . shortly after , working for your lord every saturday ."
"a country steadily heading into the dark age ... yet more law that cause harm to people , pandering to relgious fantasist and extremist ."
i would n't want to carry nor raise a brain-damaged child . that 's too much to ask of most woman . the righteous always think emotionally and religiously instead of reality .
just what the world need .... even more american
"the insane christian taliban wo n't stop until they turn america into a theocratic dictatorship , and they force u all to live a they think their imaginary sky daddy want . we must fight back ( peacefully and legally ) or they will thrust u back into the dark age ."
keep your leg closed . no problem . and ask your self `` what if my mother aborted me ? ''
so woman will end up having back street abortion and unwanted kid will be neglected and abused this is so backwards
"time to riot burn loot kill injury and destroy people 's property business and car , well ...... that 's if your a unhinged left wing marxist commie that is"
this woke snow flake world is absolutely fucked ? ? ? ? ? it 's like living in the twilight zone ! ! ! ! !
just keep your leg shut - abstinence is the best form of contraception .
"bullshit the house need only a simple majority to impeach a supreme court justice or any federal judge . to convict and then remove the justice or judge , the senate requires a two-thirds majority ."
it is victory to godly people and a death blow to satanist the abortionist .
"i do not know why they are celebrating ? the choice to abort or not it still belong to the woman , if they choose to have an abortion they will do it wether is legal or not , and that probably sometimes will cost two life ."
"pro life deluded moron , the land of the free , not very free is it ."
finally the tide of moral decline is turning . praise god
it 's still legal in most progressive state though ? !
praise be to god . i am grateful and thankful we still have righteous politician .
from conception to the time they turn gay .
btw im not sure why some guy are boasting about this ? do you understand you get almost zero access now ? it still their body . their choice so this doesnt stop access to anything . it just make it unsafer now and make it harder for you to get laid . calm down
i 'm grateful i 'm neither female nor american . this is disgusting .
"right im unsure what this mean , can they have abortion upto so many week pregnant or certain circumstance or is it just a no straight from the start ?"
it is horrifying that this is happening in 21st century america . several state will not even have exception in case of rape and incest ! it evil . shame on all of them who voted for this .
the republican will turn america into afghanistan if they are not stopped . woman right mean nothing to them . i wonder how many of trump 's girlfriend had abortion in the past ?
"this is not a federal ban on abortion . it simply return the decision to the state . the court is meant to decide the constitutionality of law , not make them ."
why are these anti-abortion people all so fat ?
a woman ha the right of ownership over her own body
"most people dont understand what happened in u . they want the court whose only job is to uphold the law a it is written and understood , to make law . that is for law maker ! so if you want any right law then choose representative who will give you what you want . meanwhile use a condiment"
such decision which effect huge section of ppl should be done through referendum .
yeah these are the one who have sex and get pregnant . and get abortion to lose those innocent tiny baby . what a shame .
"so it 's ok for baby to die , but not woman ? what about girl baby , is it ok to murder them ?"
"when they are permitted up to 9 month and including birth what do they expect . it wa never safe , legal and rare . both men and woman need to start taking responsibility for their action ."
"more baby girl are aborted . this save femicide . just behave responsibly , do not go for 500 partner simple and do not jump in the bed of every imbecile that call you . now you will have to behave , not be reckless and irresponsible . the world is going to suffer from population collapse in 2100 according to a bbc report ."
what the af is happening to america ? ? ?
the dawn of the fall of usa : )
"from the reaction of these fascist woman in the footage it look like all woman in usa were obliged to abort for 50 year . in that case i would understand these sort of reaction . but nobody want them to abort . it is more that them , a fanatic believer , want to impose their credo on other people . and off course the shadow of the scum of trump is still there .... poor usa ! ! ! ! poor america. ! ! ! continue voting the republican . good luck"
"no woman may be allowed to kill . exception are obviously acceptable in case of rape or serious health problem . nevertheless , every human being must be respected while , on the other hand , pussy may never be faced a a `` green card '' to murder innocent human being because responsibility inheres to woman 's liberty ."
a lot of unwanted child will be trafficked . that 's what they 're really celebrating . so sad
"america , the newest third world country ..."
well there go woman right ya bunch of psycho .
"why is this a big deal ? it seems it only the hill billy state doing this . sorry for my ignorance . im not from there but i dont see the big one doing it . it seems it those religious , hill billy state ."
no one ha the right to kill an innocent foetus.i support the supreme court
"fuuuuuuck i 'm genuinely in awe of this ... the utter ridiculousness that america , what is considered to be one of the most leading nation in the world , would do something like this ."
i ca n't believe this happened in the usa ....
that country is headed for a civil war . it 's actually terrifying how divided the u.s. is on so many important issue . take care my american friend .
"it right , abortion is murder and also if you dont want kid strap up"
"shame on you america . you have put the right of unborn baby before the right of living woman . take away their reproductive right , but put assault rifle in the hand of mentally ill 18 year old . shame on you . you are taking your country backwards into the dark past . shame on you ."
"great biased reporting once again bbc . you never fail , keep it up"
"why do the nation ( cnn msnbc etc ) conspire and the people plot in vain ? the king of the earth rise up and the ruler band together against the lord and against his anointed , saying , let u break their chain and throw off their shackle . the one enthroned in heaven laugh ; the lord scoff at them . he rebuke them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath , saying , i have installed my king in the supreme court ."
stupid backward congress . this ruling ha set back america 50 year
"it about time people took responsibility for their action . when a woman say `` my body my choice '' , that is n't exactly true is it . if you 're pregnant then you 've got another body in there , one without a voice . the only exception i would allow is when there is a medical risk to said woman if the pregnancy would proceed , or if she wa raped . being drunk or promiscuous is not an excuse to murder an unborn child ."
great step ! moving away from the devil that covered people 's eye by the name of `` right '' . it is weird that people march in support of killing a human being . banning abortion and improving workable protection system for woman and girl must be among the priority agenda .
"america is such a fucked up country , how a western democratic superpower like this would have such little right for their people and control people body in this way while having no safety net for people , no healthcare , no protection ; they are in no way the leader of the free world , they are a tyranny against their own people"
slut are worried now
"in today 's world , only two country issue new law against freedom and liberty , afghan taliban and america ."
it wa never a constitutional right a it is not in the constitution why are the bbc reporting fake in accurate news
"such a ridiculous ban ! ! their body , their choice !"
the fat creature saying i won today ha she got something wrong with her ?
"murica , where life is precious until the second your born . then your on your own with no universal healthcare , worker right , and you can get shot at school . i hope those policy maker enjoy living in the republic of gilead"
people should just deal with their consequence instead of killing their fetus and living their life with complete ignorance of what they have done
well the u government ha made a backyard butcher job legal now congrats idiot !
if the bbc are n't bias then why are they reporting this like it 's terrible news ?
"they do n't get so hysterical when the west genocide the third world . spoilt , self-centred woman who can not face up to the fact that the biological female can get pregnant when she ha sex ."
the medium so biased . there is obviously an agenda being displayed here . respect the decision a we would have had to if it wa the other way around and shut the f * * k up .
congrats . give people with mental health gun and now take away a woman 's right to a choice .
thank god .. no more killing of innocent baby . it is murder .... million of baby have been killed ..... get contraceptive then ..

thanks to trump 's appointment

"the christian nationalist judiciary will change the law to suit their vision of a society ruled by a reactionary elite , a society with a preferred religion and a prescribed code of sexual behavior , all backed by the coercive power of the state ."
this is excellent news . it will stop the murder of thousand .
do you mean they stop killing baby
"is the catholic church running the usa ? woman now will have to have the rapist baby and what next no contraception , no sex before marriage good grief . i feel for the unborn but really there are over 7 billion of u in this small world , nation are starving , war are raging , the planet is over heating . i feel for the unborn but they could be the lucky one , now before saving the unborn , get of your lazy backside and make a world worth living in ."
keep the ten commandment and we would not have problem with this .
"the bbc , so unbiased ! !"
america is in shamble
abortion is murder ! we stand for life !
shocking and biden just sits back and stumble a few word out . make america pathetic again . another choice lost
"how can one nation be so detrimental to it own well-being . aborting a child is wrong but allowing them to grow and be shot up in a school is just part of life . if the preservation of life is the most important thing , then the death penalty should be struck down"
they dont look like normal woman
"yes , it about time we protected the unborn . now the unborn have the right not to be murdered . unborn have soul too ."
they look and sound like men this evil anti abortion
"simple lady , take responsibility in not getting pregnant ! ! use contraception , and dont let him go ughhhh in you"
well done .. american woman crazy
"christian fundamentalism governing politics , similar to the taliban ."
"sick , divided society governed by greedy uneducated psychopats ."
it seems to me that you guy should have a refferemdom and not let a few people who think they know better than the rest of your population
"if i were a foetus , id rather be dead than born disabled with defect to people who dont want me"
united state my as at this point it just the state .
life in the united hate of america
best news ever ! god win !
there is a brexit parallel here . control of abortion ha been returned from washington ( brussels ) to the individual state ( uk ) . democracy at the state level will show u what the will of the people really is .
doctor are criminal . court decision almost 5 decade is appreciable
excellent news if people followed the word of god we wouldnt have these thing happen if your that bothered about being selfish for your own pleasure be prepared for what come after that . man and woman should not sleep around before marriage it should be in love and true harmony
man there going to be a lot of back alley abortion and death .
all glory to god
"it murder , your taking a life for god sake"
"im just worried that these pro-lifer are going to take this thing to it logical conclusion , and call for an outright ban on masturbation !"
bbc is the new cnn . all fake news all the time . this is not at all what you falsely report . there is no ban on abortion it move the decision to the individual state .. abortion is not birth control a it is being used . bbc suck
how embarrassing
i swear the u is gon na have another civil war soon
"i saw some ridiculous girl on the news singing `` jesus love the little child ! '' oh sure he doe , and now the little sweetie can go home to parent who did n't want them to begin with , out of mind of the authority ( who consider they 've done their job by 'jesus ' ) and wait to be neglected , starved and abused to death ! sometimes i think the american , a a race , are about a intelligent a mouthy school kid !"
i am pro life . we need more kid so that we can send them out to war .... to die . pro life/pro war . make sense ?
"if u dont want a baby , close them leg"
one aspect of the u constitution i did envy wa the separation of religion from politics .... '' the establishment clause prohibits all level of government from advancing or prohibiting religion '' . what happened ?
"question : if a woman wa forcefully raped by a psychotic serial killer , she would still have to keep the child but that man would , by u law be put to dead . is that what is happening ? so a woman that is forced to do something against her will , should be once again forced to do something against her will . one person that forced is sentenced to death and the other paid a salary ? is that not insanity ?"
i 'm so glad i live in a country where people can destroy unborn baby without any consequence
about time . this accepted genocide ha been going on too long . mass denial of this because you want to spread your leg .
the number of these idiot who needed to be aborted themselves is staggering .
the number of these idiot who needed to be aborted themselves is staggering
"what kind of reporting is this ? leslie rutledge saying the doctor doesnt have any fact , and no push back ? despite decade of fact . just air it a an opinion ? also most people in america support woman right to have an abortion , nowhere is that said in this report . also nowhere is it said that this is an infringement of human right . is the bbc just an opinion show now ?"
"many who are outraged at this supreme court 's decision little realize how blessed they are in america . for none of them would want to live in a society where human and divine law is no longer respected . that experiment wa already tried in ancient france , and horrific were the result . thus , those who are outraged are exhibiting that they , whether they realize it or not , have accepted the lie the god of this world continually propagates of `` do what thou wilt . '' yet , those consumed with impulsive anger over this decision are acting thus because they , whether ignorantly or willfully , have abandoned the creator god 's plan for marriage and sex , and that is complete abstinence until wedded in holy matrimony ."
"fuck pro life , i hope your daughter get raped with no possibility to abortion ."
and this is the country shaming the taliban for making their woman to wear a burqa
try taking responsibility for yourself then you dont need to get upset or happy about this
"welcome to america 2022 where you can walk down to your local walmart and buy a high-powered assault rifle to help 'protect ' your family . someone could use that rifle to go on a rampage killing innocent people . nothing is done because of the 2nd amendment and the powerful nra . yet a woman who ha become pregnant through either rape , abuse , incest or even is not mentally capable of supporting a child can no longer have the right to an abortion . it is a crazy situation to be in . in some state , woman even risk being tried for murder . all this ha done is open up backstreet abortion clinic and there is a high risk that a lot of woman could die a a result of this . america is turning into gilead more and more each day ."
let 's just face it the u can not be considered a free country anymore
the u leading the way for baby 's right .
"fifty three year ago , neil armstrong stepped on the moon and made the famous quote : one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind . now the american supreme court ha just turned that quote on it head . this is a second giant leap ... only this time it 's backwards . how in the world can the u of a , the so-called land of the free , be trusted to oppose dictatorship like russia when they 're intent on cracking down on liberty like this ? we in britain should have been reducing tie to america instead of europe at the rate thing are going ."
very good decision .
"if only these woman had access to condom , contraceptive pill , contraceptive patch or contraceptive coil .... oh wait"
people are upset that they are reducing killing of life ? i think it 's great a woman use abortion a contraception these day hopefully it will make ppl more sexually reserved and wise .
now american would laugh and look down upon on those country which allow abortion legally . american syndrome laugh over ever thing which is different from their country .
"lie ! ten of million do not have a right to abortion ? it is state by state . they are free to travel to get an abortion . leftist propaganda , all of this ."
i think they should consider regulation of gun first rather than mobilizing crowd to act more violent .
"same old lying bbc ! it 's nit been struck down , banned or anything like that ! tyw supreme court ha just given the decision to the state ! you 're a bad a chabnel 4 ! may a well cone oyt of the closet , and just admit you 're a left wing propaganda machine !"
america willingly marching itself back into the dark age . what a silly childish move .
there is irony in the fact that nineteen child were shot to death in their classroom and the same people who claim to ban abortion to protect unborn child refuse to ban the military-type weapon that kill real child .
it 's time for u men to do our part and stop treating sex a a recreational activity and letting our hormone get the best of u . sex is for mature men in committed relationship ; and thinking otherwise already debases woman into sexual object and unequal human value . i know because i have been there . but we can learn from our mistake and do better . let 's treat woman with the respect they deserve .
these people are crazy ! just sickening i feel for the woman of this country i hope they find access else where
no prob they could canada for it
when u get too much freedom that u even wo n't realise what 's basic right are and when were they taken away .
so they make abortion illegal but make it legal to carry a gun that can take more life 's . so when they commit suicide a can not get abortion i hope these people realise they have killed 2 people
i dont understand why cant they just go on the pill or use condom
"if there so pro life why is it so hard to to get stricter gun law passed . child being shot in class room , it just doe n't make sense ."
usa = god home
if there going to make abortion illegal they should make all you religious nut support the child your so concerned about !
"go on puny human , go do the bidding of the elite and divide yourselves with anger , take to the street in time of coming war and fight each other because you ca n't have sex without consequence . 'will of the people ' , what good is the will of the people if they 're programmed by tik tok / china ."
"all life matter . a dog 's life matter . the heartbeat in that 10 week old matter . `` before i formed you in the womb , i knew you . ''"
not a land of dream anymore .
it time to abide by the right of a person even unborn to life a enshrined in the u constitution .
it is not the right to abortion that ha been struck down - typical miss reporting by the bbc . all that ha happened is that each state now ha the power to make it own law concerning abortion .
"and with an outpouring of misinformation the bbc yet again demonstrate to the world why they should be shutdown completely . judge do n't get to make up new right and grant them to the citizen in any democracy , because that make it not a democracy . if amerircans want the 'right ' to abortion , they 're gon na have to get it via democratic representation , not via misuse of law to have an unelected , appointed branch of government create and grant it , like a taliban council ."
"because it wa found that roe v wade wa based on ironically `` a woman telling lie '' due to that , law is clear the case must be overturned . so now if they want to murder their baby in utero then they have to go state level . still ca n't avoid , baby helping to kill mother , may still have a chance for rape baby . but either way , today is a good day because all the woman who are protesting want is the right to both screw and cheat without consequence .. do n't want kid 2 thing you can do . abstain or use birth control . great day ."
oh yea w in the chat
the u is slowly destroying itself from the inside out . the republican influence is two hundred year behind the time and is dragging the country into serious division and conflict .
"wow life and death . serious consequence of death for an unborn human . abortion clinic work mcdonald 's is hiring . it better to feed people burger and chicken then to kill what god ha created . yeah give life fill stomach with life , not your pocket with death profiteering . dont keep the horror of fetal murder going . what person ha the right privilege in free america to just dictate what life is or is n't . 50 year ago a bunch of old , over the hill , already had family , morally deviant power broker , made it ok to murder unborn human offspring . an entirety new money market of desperate emotional people manipulated into hating their own baby . a book said that a day would come when a woman would take their baby off their breast and throw them in the fire , to eat . taking a life , that is know a life ( from the beginning ) by all people world over . life is life . the byproduct of two human a male and female is ... male or female of combined hunan genetic tissue . we call them new born , baby 's , inf"
american woman will have to choose another contraception method .
abortion still exists in the usa . the u federal government will return each individual state the right to decide their own abortion law for themselves .
dumbest country on earth right now america . woman are becoming a object over there now and those knobhead men going on about it .. they should n't even have a say over what woman can n cant do with her body . all them crap wack state more like a clut overran by religious crap .. wont belong before they have the woman on collar and leash
plonkers . i rest my case . a planetary disgrace .
take down that stupid article on your website about billie eilish and sack mark savage for poor journalism . abortion wa never a constitutional right . complete lie by the bbc . lie and poor journalism . no wonder people dont believe anything you write anymore .
so you are telling me people cant just go around and have sex and get pregnant and then murder an unwanted child ? ? what a decision ! great ruling !
"is abstaining from sex murder ? after all , it 's preventing life from coming into being and must surely , therefore , be a 'sin ' ?"
vagina people now will think twice before looking for adventure or just move to the blue state .
life is the most precious thing and although i understand the desire of female to kill the fetus life is the most important thing . the unimaginably precious baby is the most important thing and although the desire of woman to want to have wonton sex and not have to be a mother and be obligated to the baby is understandable the right to life of the baby supersedes all other human desire or want .
pfff pro-life woman said `` we build a better world '' - really ? ? ? ? did you pas the law about free contraception ? or free baby formula ? ? or anything to actually help those unwanted kid ? vomiting .
"pro life message , you csn not have an abortion but you can buy a semi autonmatic weapon . once you are born , you are on your own ."
the bbc is giving too much time to the forced-birthers . why is their picture on the thumbnail ?
another country were everything is policed .... except crime .
"pro abortionist only have to attend one abortion to turn totally against it . imagine pulling a baby to piece with forceps , and putting the body part on a tray so they could be counted . that is what abortion is ! nothing but murder ! i totally support freedom of choice : if you made the decision to have sex , live with the consequence . no-one ha the right to terminate another 's life"
"well for those who voted for it , i hope you dont get raped then up the duff . every human being is unique in their body and it should always be the woman individual choice , this is just christians/ rich powerful home wrecker forcing their opinion on people . left wing c * * t"
"that anyone ever thought they had a right over someone el life is obscure , that the bbc would defend a right to kill is atrocious ."
"a a pro-choice attorney , the court made the correct decision . abortion wa never a constitutional right . abortion is a political issue better left for each state and their voter to decide . the decision doe not preclude a woman right to travel to a state that allows abortion ."
and they say america is freedom
biden need to arrest the pedophile and rapist and stop protecting them
"i get it abortion after a certain length of pregnancy is wrong but what about if the mother life is at risk ? what about ectopic pregnancy ? a septic uterus ? or a miscarriage that your body wont release is abortion ! this why i love islam because it a religion full of wisdom , in islam you can have a abortion if the mother life is at risk ."
they will brake law now trying to play god or shall we say kill baby . the baby is innocent so are th victim the only one who should get a life of pain in jail are the rapist
"hmm wasnt the u built on separation of church and state ? , theyve done it again , embarrassed themselves in front of the world ."
america is the devil
"disgusting , i thought america wa a farce already but this is just ridiculous"
this is not about pro-life ; it about anti-woman .
and you call it civilized country ?
ye coz not like we 're in a climate and food and population crisis . what we need is a huge rise in kid people ca n't afford to feed or ouse
why is the bbc promoting this ?
jesus love the little child disgusting . who do these people think they are to force their religion on others .
backward country
why do i only see older white woman supporting the court ruling .
"make no mistake , for the republican leader behind this , it wa never about the right or wrong of abortion . it wa always about control . they do n't give a damn about unborn baby , and never did . they want to control every minute aspect of your life , and the gullible , nave pro-lifer are handing them that control on a plate ."
open padma bridge bangladesh world record
leftist do a good job showing why they should never make any decision .
"for abortion to be legal both the man and woman should agree to the abortion . the choice wa made to conceive when you were ragged all over for 15mins . if you were raped you should also be allowed an abortion . you do not have a right to an abortion because a soon a you use advanced medical knowledge to induce abortion it is no longer a right . you have a right to water , it doe not have to be clean ."
the yank need more budding shooter pew pew pew
not abortion
next thing the american law maker will do is probably make their female wear a burka
very good decision
they should have banned jesus instead : )
thats right u . just let more woman have child so they can go to school and get murdered by some nutter with a gun . great ! how about overturn the gun law before being pro-life
"good . common sense prevails . seems like the supreme court is our last line defence against and at the minute it holding up . next , phizer . no wait , we won that too stop wef"
"whoop whoop great stuff , thank you , jesus"
"i am pro-becky who found out at her 20 week anatomy scan that the infant she wa so excited to bring into this world had developed without life sustaining organ . i am pro-susan who wa sexually assaulted on her way home from work , only to come to the horrific realization that her assailant planted his seed in her when she got a positive pregnancy test result a month later . i am pro-theresa who hemorrhaged due to a placental abruption , causing her parent , spouse , and child to make the impossible decision whether to save her or her unborn child . i am pro-little cathy who had her innocence ripped away from her by someone she should of been able to trust and her 11 year old body is n't mature enough to bear the consequence of that betrayal . i am pro-melissa who 's working 2 job just to make end meet who ha to choose between bringing a other child into poverty or feeding the child she already ha because her spouse walked out on her . i am pro-brittany who realizes that she is in no way financially , emotionally or physically able to raise a child . i am pro-emily who went through ivf ending up with six viable implanted egg requiring selective reduction in order to ensure the safety of her and a safe amount of fetus . i am pro-christina who doe n't want to be a mother , but birth control method sometimes fail . i am pro-jessica who is finally getting the strength to get away from her physically abusive spouce only to find out that she is carrying the monster 's child . i am pro-vanessa who went into her confirmation appointment after year of trying to conceive only to hear silence where there should be a heartbeat . i am pro-lindsay who lost her virginity in her sophomore year with a broken condom and now ha to choose whether to be a teenage mom or just a teenager . i am pro-courtney who just found out she 's already 13 week along , but the egg never made it out of the fallopian tube so either she terminates the pregnancy or risk dying from internal bleeding . you can argue and say that i 'm pro-choice all you want , but the truth is i 'm pro-life . their life . woman 's life . you do n't get to pick and choose which scenario should be accepted . woman 's right are meant to protect all woman , regardless of their situation !"
"i present to you america , the land of the free ... so long a it 's not personal freedom you seek ."
make america great britain again
america are the richest 3rd world country in the world from the gun law to health care to now this so happy i dont live in such a fucked up country with braindead people
"different country , different rule . who are we in the uk to dictate our view on others ."
"there never wa a right to an abortion ! it not in the bill of right nor is it in the constitution . the supreme court misinterpreted back in the early 70 the 14th amendment of the constitution which a of yesterday wa rectified . abortion wa not eliminated , but thrown back to the individual state to make their own mind up if they want legalized murder in their state . so please dont read into this that which is not there !"
very happy news . killing is not a right .
i wonder if jesus will feed them a he love them so much . this make me so mad . is it not better to terminate a pregnancy when the parent ca n't look after it . i really do n't understand this decision and it ha definitely made america seem more backward in the eye of the rest of the world .
pro life believer and protestors must start by abolishing war first to prove that they are all genuine .
america is going backwards instead of progressing . sad day . religion in favour of science by a bunch of fundamentalist .
if your terrified girl use a rubber
a a lot of people have said im sure woman dont have an abortion lightly . will all those protesting about abortion now devote their life to looking after the child that will now be born ? and not even if a woman ha been raped or through incest ? insanity .
"do we 'like ' the win , or 'dislike ' the hysterical news reporting ? choice choice ."
the u is coming back to moral standard . yes there is hope
land of the free ..
no one would screw either of those woman unless they needed a green card or food stamp ..... reality 101
love the bbc but first time giving thumb up for this story . r v w struck down !
woman and girl who have been raped will be forced to have that baby . the foster care system and orphanage are already overwhelmed and underfunded . pro lifer do n't care about these baby after they are born .
"people are upset because they can no longer kill their own baby in the womb . president ronald regan famously said - i 've noticed that everyone who is for abortion ha already been born . over 60 million defenceless baby overwhelmingly murdered in the womb for convenience in the usa alone , and from people who were given the chance to be born . when a woman ha an abortion , she 's not killing her own body , she 's killing someone else 's body ."
"again , bbc fake news , not all u state will ban abortion . this is a victory of good over evil so naturally the bbc is pissed off ."
anyone else sit on the fence on this ? could argue both way ?
how sad while others cant bare child
the abortion industry trading in the body part of baby is disgusting
america : ban abortion - abortionist are murderer ! same america : protect our right to easily own gun !
very good decision by the supreme court of america ..... god bless america ..... moral and etical value must be preserved for the betterment of humanity
ive seen the devastation that abortion ha brought on our country what .. jesus christ some people are retarded
"this is the world just going backwards in the first instance , it will just send woman back underground to get abortion . are we not ment to be progressive society not a backward one . the person that started the campaign probably ha stepped back from the issue . i pray that all the people against it never have something happen to them that could result in the ever needing one , if they look to most religion doe it not show that god give people the right to choose which path they take ? . this is so ignorant and stupid that this ha happened . i can see a big reset happening , have we not learned anything ? ?"
"it 's a good thing . that they did this , it give an opportunity to the whole world , to observe , what happens , in next few year . it 's better to learn from other 's mistake , then your own ."
"abortion wa not struck down ! each state just get to independently decide if it will be legal in their state now . this is how democracy work . the more liberal state will allow abortion , but now , more pro-life state get the choice to ban it legally if they wish . this is a big win for democracy and freedom . the medium make it sound so bad but it is quite the opposite , yet again !"
the usa is a backwards theocracy . who knew ?
yes ! ! ! no more death to baby !
what overturning same sex marriage ? ?
america is a third world country
mentally ill people
this is absolutely terrifying . i feel fortunate to not have been born is u
excellent news . no more killing baby
"stupidity ha frontier , mexico and canada ."
"wow , congratulation !"
look at those `` activist '' ! !
the anti abortionist should have been aborted .
"oh brilliant ! child service ca n't keep kid safe now , how will they cope with thousand more baby born to mother who do n't want them ? i hope the government up funding for the repercussion to come ."
funny all those girl happily cry against abortion look like the girl that will never get pregnant of have a boyfriend ..
it 's amazing to know that le and le baby of colour will be aborted now < 3
you can not blame the child for your action it real simple
no greater evil than abortion .
"come to your sens , woman will still continue to get rid of unwanted pregnancy , but those who need it - will have to do it illegaly while facing a real life treatening danger ( because not done in proper medical facility ) and health consequence . better choice is to provide free contraception or/and baby food ! but no , you wont do it ..."
"if a woman is raped the child is innocent , 3-4 year mandatory minimum sentence for rape . the woman get pregnant 10 - 15 year ! punish the men who do this ! dont murder child"
bunch of fat ugly woman who will never get pregnant unless they pay on the pro life team
"wow i wish people would understand before commenting , maybe if the bbc didnt falsely headline they might , abortion ha not been made illegal , the law ha simply been pushed back to the individual state to decide whether it can be done in that particular state , yes some state will make it illegal but others wont"
"who else wonder how american do barely anything to stop the 45,000 people who die of gun-related death every year , but are happy to take away the right of woman to stop a few abortion ."
why is the world going against the logic it taken u thousand of year to reach ? everyone is a hero campaigner get over yourselfs not your body
"they always isolate these victim , overall abortion right help destroy the family model and endorses unethical relationship"
america ha a good heart at it core after all . and ive seriously never felt appreciative of trump .
look at all those transphobes claiming that abortion is a `` woman 's issue '' . bunch of terfs .
genuine question .... how many of the supreme court are men ? ?
"so if a woman get pregnant from rape , she ha to have the baby and raise it ? will she also be forced to allow the dad ( rapist ) right to see the baby ? good job america ."
"did that jennifer thomson just say it heart breaking that she ha to turn these irresponsible woman away and then say im sorry if your boy friend beat you up every day and rape you you will have to find another way , no if your dumb enough to stay with a man that beat you and rape you everyday or every other day then you cant complain . another girl said im 21 and scared well act and make responsible decision then those two woman said we thought this country cared about people and woman not at anytime did she mention about the little human inside the womb and that is the reason why the right ha been taken away someone ha to think about the little person ."
"abortion ha never been in the american constitution . this is pure misinformation , nothing more ."
"america do not care about life , the government/corporations must need more body in prison & child in care to keep their profit up ... this is wrong , woman should have access to safe abortion care ... the interesting thing is , america do not give free contraception and the very people protesting against abortion are the one who are against welfare and free medical care , to force someone to keep a child they do not want is a recipe for disaster , this is a crime against the poor"
this is gon na ruin the porn industry
thats the end for the wicked evil planned parenthood organisation
those who support and carry out abortion for reason other than medical are murderer . shame to you . woe to them !
`` time 's up '' for the hateful ideology called feminism .
i agree with this abortion unless it is for medical reason is murder ! take responsibility for your sexual behaviour men and woman ! we a a race take sex far too casually
"what a load of crap , anyone wanting to kill baby can still go to another state and get it done . majority of state still allow it but the way some of these people talk it like they want to use it a a contraceptive . and some want it all the way up to birth . sick ."
the god of creation said be fruitful and multiply read holy biblegenesis 1:28
"interesting how american are anti-abortion because it 'murders ' unborn foetus , but are pro-guns despite having school shooting every other week . double standard much . they sure like to control other people but dont want the same treatment themselves ."
about time . it 'll be either russia or trump 's fault no doubt .
"a sad day for woman and their right to choose . i see too many woman pregnant from abuse , rape and violence . what choice have these woman got ? now to be reminded on a daily basis of what ha and will continue to happen . ok america , tighten up your law .. if you need to .. .. big mistake making it illegal . you have set woman freedom of choice back 50 year . put u back to being second class citizen what next .. removing woman right to vote ? shame on you !"
"and it getting ? to big to ignore , why so many at the bbc are allowed to still use blackface when presenting these thing ."
if woman were not given the choose or do n't have the money to take care of kid what are they meant to do now ? not right .
"this is horrible . coming back to a stone age , where woman had no right to open a bank account or get an education .... ("
this is good
what an inflammatory headline !
"i am not religious . just consider thinking something . if you come across a child with terminal illness , consider asking her whether she would have liked to die before she wa born . i think you know her answer . she 'd be glad to being able to see the world albeit in pain . when a life is conceived , without forceful intent ( say rape ) , you no longer own that life . just like a human/animal ha every right to live , an unborn baby , who ha no capacity to take the decision on their part , should not be killed , unless she is killed by natural reason or is a risk to her mother 's life . please have common sense before starting to exercise your all entitling attitude ."
"i get this but also dont , people getting knocked up left and right dont deserve abortion but if it life threatening for the woman then i feel it should be legal . this is a horrible decision . they shouldve made law to abortion like it it life threatening let them get it but if the child is healthy and the woman wont suffer from said birth i feel they shouldnt have an abortion . i also feel if they get raped they should have the option ."
such a messed up country . all of these rape and incest baby will have the right to bear arm in le than 20 year . you can almost guarantee more school shooting .
america is truly backwards . one day it 's ok to have gun and kill child in school the next a woman ca n't make a choice over her own body . do n't you ever criticize other country ! the world is laughing at you. ! ! ! ! !
"this is the beginning , good bye gay marriage"
"biden could extent the board of judge , that my change the majorityin at the surprimecourt , ... he would have the 51 in the senate"
"god win , the satanic left go under . now the paid anti fa clown are coming back to the street . trump forever ."
i 'm 21 and terrified
the supreme court said this wa going to happen even before they had a chance to hear the case . let the church pay tax to support all the child that this will produce . they have had a free ride for to long .
now rapist can do their thing without the threat of having their sperm wasted . praise jesus !
land of the free leader of the world one of the most delusional dangerous country on the planet .
"this judgement is not just about the right to abortion . it is the removal of the right to destroy a child , right up to the moment of a full term , natural birth . an abortion , a we know it in the uk , is the termination of a pregnancy where the foetus doe not have a heartbeat and is incapable of independent movement . overturning roe v wade wa removing the right to murder viable child . also , the 'rights ' to abortion enshrined in roe v wade were in the process of being expanded to ban police from investigating and prosecuting infant mortality of child under the age of 28 day ( after birth ) . abortion law wa never in the purview of federal government . the u constitution demand that anything not specifically covered in the bill of right should be adjudicated at the state level , where the time limit will be set by elected representative and local elector can influence the decision . the bbc know this . presenting the decision of the scotus a an infringement of the human right of woman is a deliberate act of deception . it is nothing of the sort . it is about preventing the willful murder of child ."
god this is scary ! ! it like going backwards .
"good job , supreme court ! abortion must n't be considered a a right . a killing are in many way , anti abortion measure restricts one of those way ."
"not too sure why people are getting bent out of shape over this ruling , let be honest , 99 % of woman in the u wont even think about having an abortion , the undesirable 1 % who blame everyone else for their demise will suffer only . if youve been raped , thats a whole different issue where it should be allowed ."
"i am pro-life , but also pro-using the term `` birthing people '' ."
"`` extreme '' ... `` radical '' ... this is all we hear from the left . `` finally , we 've criminalised murder '' ... is all we hear from the right . this is n't about whether abortion is right or wrong , it about whether the people should decide this . this is the way the usa wa supposed to be before they started federalising everything ."
who care it gumpland nobody care
"`` jesus love the little child . '' yeah , that 's why he allowed so many of them to be killed in uvalde right ? right ?"
god ha opened the ear of american leader . abortion is a murder and murder is a biggest sin .
"and the catholic supreme court ha done it again ! another great morally correct action under the eye of the morally right conservative republican ... no to abortion . no killing of fetus .. only grown ups . that explains why the same supreme court will let everybody in ny to get a gun now ... let 's go ! i wonder if god would be a fair guy and let these justice have their daughter and wife raped and forced to carry the criminal 's baby in their womb for 9 month .. and then give birth , raise and support that child for the rest of their life . i would like to see that . america great country , for some ."
silent killer finally come to an end
"abortion is sometimes an unavoidable choice , but not a right . do n't be arrogant . no one ha the right to kill a person . for example , is the choice to stop a ventilator in a person with brain death a right ? it is sometimes an unavoidable choice , not a right . do n't be arrogant ."
arguing about woman will die ? but baby dying are okey ?

"not a word here about the damage abortion cause to woman , of which the the pro-choice movement ha precious little , it seems , to say ."
we have a fool for a president .
"i 'm curious what ireland think about this , since they 're the most traditionally anti-abortion nation ."
my first reaction ? hallelujah . at last the tide is turning in favour of the unborn child . there may well be a return to backstreet abortion and woman may travel to other state who defy this 'strike down ' but what doe n't seem to be mentioned here are the million of life lost since roe -v- wade wa introduced ; million of life whose tax could have funded even obamacare ; the workforce who could have kept the u going ; and not a word about woman who have had termination and lived to regret their choice .
america clapped anyways
it mean that million of unborn baby will have a chance at life .

imagine a woman whom got rape and is deny abortion !
`` right '' to kill child in the womb struck down by u supreme court .
"so if a woman wa r * ped , then she ha to deal with 38 week of the baby growing . whoa"
another ludicrous piece of legislation by the u what a bunch of emotive fatbangers .
but what if a woman is raped ? just imagine the awful experience of having to look after that child or having to sadly give the child away . also imagine the awful increase of population . it better to remove it when it inside the woman then to kill it when it and fully grown and released . to think so many mother will now end the baby life a it released into the world a they are now unable to abort it . to think these child will now grow up much worse and in much more awful experience a foster home increase and of course violence will arrive .
these are sex mad they will kill for it !
trump win even when not in office .
"there 's no constitutional right to abortion , once again the bbc lying and twisting the truth , the bbc side with baby killer ."
`` care '' = killing child according to this report
"the problem here is that woman ca n't make decision on whether they want to have a kid or not any more , for someone who doe n't want kid , why force them to have one , yes , sure do n't get pregant , dump that guy , blah blah , but thing happen yet we do n't get to decide what we can do any more . for woman who are living on the street , or drug addict when they have baby , the baby will be drug baby , they will have behavioral problem due to drug abuse from the mother .. if a drug addict doe n't want to keep the baby , she should have her own right to do abortion safely , i do n't see anythign wrong with it , it 's cruel to force someone to have a child when they don '' t want ..... some hypocrite just simiply thinking killing a fetus is wrong , but forcing someone to have baby is wrong too ! not mention there are other reason ... it 's never black and white .. regardless , taking away this option , is not right .."
how can they chat and cheer for life when their gun reform law are a total joke . the right to kill if you think person wa worthy of dying . so corrupt . absolute stupid logic this . it all about pissing the demo off and vi versa . all about funding their individual state . raging at this . absolutely raging .
"thank god , their right to murder ha been withdrawn !"
it 's hard to defend abortion and also hard to be anti abortion . one side it could kill the mother and on the other your killing a helpless baby so fucked all around really .
disgusting that state court doe not fulfill the will of the majority . this is only the will of the few - career polititions and overpowered judge . @ $ # // %
all the anti-abortionists deserve to be raped and impregnated by paedophile .
"well , since life begin at conception , how can a person scientifically and scriptural deny that it is not an embryo . you see dead thing do not grow . it is that simple . when jehovah god wa speaking with the prophet jeremiah , he told the young prophet in jeremiah 1:5 that when he wa forming jeremiah in the belly of his mother that `` i knew you '' . jehovah could read the `` spirit in the bone in the belly of her who is pregnant '' ( ecclesiastes 11:5 ) . in the book of roman 9:11-13 jehovah read the `` spirit '' in the bone if you will , of both jacob and esau . in psalm 139:13-16 king david wrote about jehovah saw even king david 's embryo . life start at conception , cause dead thing do n't grow . if two men got into a fight and in the process of fighting they caused a pregnant woman to have a miscarriage and the fetus died , one or both of them had to forfeit their life ( exodus 21 : 22-23 ) . all these scripture show how the creator , jehovah god view the growing embryo in the belly of her that is pregnant . he view them a a living human . human life . human child . killing the child inside the belly of her that is pregnant is from the creator standpoint , murder . to see what the bible say on the topic of abortion , and so much more , simply go to the totally free , most translated website on the internet , no sign in or out , no registration , no information gathered on you , all browsing and downloads are free , private . please go to jw.org"
finally the mass killing of unborn baby .. is stopped . the u is now a better country today .
use contraception it not that hard
in reality woman really want abortion a a safety measure for the bad decision they take .
"just think about how many kid there are in foster care , or who are not wanted and are living a shitty life . the mother dont abort the child because they find pleasure in killing child . what if the mom seriously cant provide a healthy life for the kid ? there are already enough kid in foster care , abortion is not murder . edit : plus why the hell are people worrying about other people buisness and abortion anyways ? it aint your child or buisness so stay the heck out of it ."
"close to million baby are murdered by abortion every year in the usa . that is horrific , there no reasonable argument that can defend this casual destruction of human life"

"turkey do hair transplant , dentist work and now abortion . the care system is about to be overwhelmed by kid being dumped on them and expect the suicide rate to increase . the fact someone could be raped then forced to carry a child is going to have serious implication . america is about to fall"
weird how the people that scream about saving the planet say that the future generation to come dont deserve the right to life ? ?
u always wa lying cretin and agressive country . punishment is coming for mlns killed people in the world .
"just phrase by the news lady `` guaranteed right to abortion '' killing a young child is a constitutional right ? , i get there could be exception like when it save the life of a mother , but to phrase it a a right is no bueno"
abortion is not healthcare . it 's murder .
this is why i have never wanted to move to the u . the evangelicals which trump ha piled into the court will destroy that country .
trumptards : dont restrict my right to gun ! also trumptards : but do restrict woman right to their own body !
"this is a great victory for men & for our female warrior ( who want to be men too ) , for they have struck a great blow towards the destruction of democracy & the ability to choose for one self . hurrah ! for men rule woman that bit more now . if i could become the elected leader of thinking woman ( who want to stay woman ) , i would recommend they no longer have sex with men until the movie 'suffragette 2 ' is released ! where the plot ha been changed to remove woman ability to vote ! .......... dun dunn duuunn ! there will be no limit to the amount of absurdity i could unleash on the general population . 1/ i would create law to force men to pay child support for child they did n't want & could n't afford . 2/ i would create childrens home to look after all the unwanted child , that even the ' anti-abortionists ' would n't look after , this in turn would financially cripple the city . where america would eventually f & * k themselves into financial ruin . 3/ arrest you for being a murderer when you leave my state for another to have an abortion there . do n't come back if you leave . everyone know , there 's nothing more democratic than voting to have your medical option taken away from you . i would feel the need to sit back and watch the movie that hollywood make out of it all ... starring the old cast from the original ' look who 's talking ' movie . i will order my popcorn now ... and prepare for the new era which will come to be known a ... 'the great time of mazturbaishin ' ."
"banning/outlawing activity or good doe n't make them disappear , it merely make them go underground ( and it greatly increase the cost/risk ) . it 's not a question of letting abortion happen vs. not happen , because they will happen regardless . the question is : should they be safe ( legal abortion ) , or should they be dangerous ( illegal abortion ) ? think of drug , even alcohol , and the toll society ha paid when substance were rendered illegal . it boggles the mind that the u.s. , at least a part of it , is still living in the distant past compared to the rest of the modern world ."
do n't like the verdict ? keep your leg closed . unborn life matter ! ! ! !
it is a great day ... at last the unborn defenseless baby have protection from being murdered ...
98 % of all woman aborting got pregnant a a result of sex before mirrige aka adultery .

abortion wa never a right . it 's not in the constitution anywhere .
a good time to watch `` junior '' with arnold schwarzenegger is this weekend .
"for normal woman and girl who consider having an abortion it very traumatic to have an abortion . i cant imagine anyone is having an abortion lightly . but in some situation , like pregnancy through rape , poverty , illness , etc . it should be there a a last resort and a early a possible . making that decision for others is unfair . are the people making that judgement also happy to foster , adopt , support poor mother . plus the system a it is is atrocious , getting worse for most american , especially child . crap education , housing or even homelessness , crime , violence , rising living cost , lack of employment , abandonment , abuse by their carers , failing social child protection service . and there seemed to be far too many child abused even killed ."
use and demand a condom to prevent pregnancy
"before it get out of hand realse the federal right wa struck down . so it 's like england , wale , scotland and n. ireland get to decide individually on abortion . that 's it ."

"america leaf afghanistan , now half of it is run by the taliban . ironic ?"
"you can feel sorry for them all you like- but the left wanted full term abortion . yes , thats killing a fully formed baby that just hasnt been born yet . some leftist state had even aborted baby after they had just been born . thats murder no matter how you dress it up . no one ha a right to do that ."
there will be anarchy in the street .

"great ... massive inflation , so they brought abortion right to the front of news . smoke curtain to draw attention from what is going on ."
"the ironic thing is , this will lead to leftist rioting , looting and burning in leftist state , where in those state abortion is still legal . they are going to literally burn their own stuff down ."
usa just a third world country wearing a gucci belt
they are evolving just backward
bbc fake news . abortion is not in the constitution and the supreme court ha only relegated the abortion decision to state level . this is a great win for donald trump . in trump we trust .
wrong ! right only exist when given by government ... ... there are no natural right .. ! scotus did not ban abortion ... it gave that decision-power to the state ... ! factually incorrect and biased ... !
you mean i cant sleep around and just abort the consequence ? die conservative
that 's a lie . they have not been totally reversed
karma ! too many opinion on other woman from other part of the world .
"well , they have to keep those classroom full for the shooting spree ..."
"get ready for a summer of leftist ( see fascist ) idiot in their monkeypox mask ( easier to hide from the cctv ) protesting ( see rioting ) in various city across the u . obviously , this wo n't occur in their own back yard a their leftist city will still allow abortion regardless of the ruling a they are state controlled . expect death threat , violence , damage to government building and local business . oh and of course let 's not forget the killing of baby too . tolerance at it 's finest !"
there seems to be a lot of supreme court justice when asked about the roe v wade question simply lied .
"june 24 the day that the unborn got their civil right and protection from being unjustly murdered by sexually irresponsible degenerate , who refuse to take responsibility for their action ."
"it will still be in the hand of the people . when half are for it and half are against it , it is best for the state to decide ."
abortion group must mind that they would be disappeared if their mom own it

now woman learn word - responsibility
america : no abortion school shooting : thought and prayer it 's a joke they value `` life '' until it come into the world
"the supreme court did not make abortion illegal . the ruling wa to say the supreme court did not have the right in the first place to make this law . they were correcting what wa in effect and illegal law at the time in 1973. the supreme court are basically saying you in the congress must pas the abortion law . it wa not the responsibility or the legal right of the supreme court to create a law that permitted abortion in 1973. joe biden of course is squirming away from his responsibility a the president a are the democratic party . they are blaming the court when they a the elected party , can immediately table their bill to legalise abortion across all state . it 's the classic cowardly politician a bit like what happens here in britain , where they want to point the finger somewhere else when in fact it lie with the elected government . the principal would be a if our own supreme court in the united kingdom wrote a law and implemented it without parliament having agreed to the writing of the law and without the supreme court having the power to implement the law . once again , we see poor journalism from the bbc who do not represent the truthful fact of how this issue ha come about but simply advocate for abortion . it doe n't even get into the deep moral issue around the right of a child . remembering that in some state , the abortion law allows the killing of a child right up to the point it leaf the womb where effectively , the child would otherwise be viable outside of the womb had it been born naturally . we should also remember that there are a wide range of contraception which should prevent pregnancy in the first place if a woman want to manage her risk in a more effective way . i recognise that in america , there may be challenge around that given that healthcare is not free at the point of provision . we should also recognise that we are actively killing a human being . the deep challenge of course is when doe that collection of cell moving towards fetal development become `` a human being '' . the ethical problem is that we are saying woman 's right are greater than those of a dependent child when woman do actually have the alternative contraception option to prevent the pregnancy in the first place . of course , there should be exception such a rape or criminal abuse towards woman where abortion should be in place along with all of those issue of clinical risk . the right of the person who is not yet born versus the right of the woman who ha power over the unborn person is the stress test of society . it feel to me that `` abortion '' ha become more like another contraception option where a woman ha failed to make proper contraception plan to prevent pregnancy in the first place . and yes , god forbid , i am saying that woman do have `` responsibility '' to manage contraception . responsibility in today 's world seems to be something that belongs to someone else ."
"so what about a woman who ha been raped ? should they be forced to keep the child ? yes it is not the child 's fault but it is not the woman 's fault neither - she did not ask to be raped , so therefore , she should have the right to an abortion ."
quick one a im the other side of the world . if you can travel state line for an abortion legally if it illegal in your state . doe that mean they can now cross state line to buy cannabis for the same reason ?
"remember when alcohol wa banned in the early 20th century ? it did n't stop people drinking alcohol . people illegally made and sold booze all over the place . same thing 's happening here . banning abortion will not stop them , it will only make them more dangerous by being preformed by people who are n't trained doctor ."
"1. prove it not a baby and just a cluster of cell and i would agree with abortion . 2. if it ha a heart , a brain and can feel pain ( after 8-9 week ) there is no logical reason why anyone should be allowed to kill a baby particularly when 99 % + of abortion are preventable and 100 % are preventable after 8 week when a baby can feel pain by doing just 1 pregnancy test a month ( 6 max ) when sexually active . 3. if you are having protected sex and do 1 pregnancy test a month ( 6 ) when you are sexually active , no baby will need to feel pain for your sexual pleasure . how could anyone not do that ? 4. at least before 8 week you wont be putting a baby through pain . 24 week in the uk or later in special circumstance is ridiculous . you can have a baby at 23 week and it ha about a 50 % chance of survival . obviously killing a new born 23 week baby would be the worst crime imaginable but if the baby is in the exact same state and just hasnt been delivered yet it seen a a great thing vital for woman right ? 5. if you are prepared to have sex be prepared to have a baby , no one should suffer for your sexual pleasure . i should also say that before i looked into it i wa pro abortion but i think more people should be concerned about putting baby ( or foetus ) through pain when this is preventable . we are living in a society of 0 accountability ."
"these pro-choice devil 's are the same animal who go round telling people that eating meat is murder yet they have no problem killing child also , the pro-choice devil 's who are complaining that they have lost their right to choose ..... it 's very easy saying that because their already born"

"ironic that this court case came from mississippi , a backwards state with high child poverty rate . congrats , mississippi , you now are getting more kid to abuse and neglect ."
"good ! abortion is n't your plan a ! in a perfect world people could have abortion out of necessity - but over 200k abortion a year is a complete joke . accidental pregnancy with condom and the pill are individually 15/100 and 1/100 respectively - combined that number should be very low . but 200k accidental pregnancy a year , people are looking at abortion a if it wa a right instead of a privlidge and a lot of inhuman animal abused the system by killing baby . good riddance , now you dog will have to actually practice safe sex . the horror , right ?"
just take necessary precaution to not get pregnant . all acting like it inevitable that youre going to get pregnant . about time woman took responsibility for once

"how embarrassing . the passage of this law is part of the war of religion against each other . they pas a law to protect the fetus . woman are seen a a bag in which future soldier should grow . but , in the case of the hundred of thousand of child who fall victim to violence and war every year , child who go to war by force , child who work on the street , child who are trafficked for sexual purpose and organ , and dozen another catastrophe , the legislator and men of god are dumb and blind . sorry ! i forgot ! child victim of sexual harassment in the church . more than 300,000 victim a year , in france alone . church leader may need more child to meet their sexual need . maybe handmades tale ha already started ."

the u is socially evolving backwards
fantastic news ! ! ! !
"the separation of church and state is over , the usa is fucked ."
"yeah , murica the freedom land"
no .. the right to abortion lie in the state that vote to have the right of abortion . thats why local election are important . if you want to murder your child then vote for it .. if you dont want to murder your child then vote against it . it that simple .
good . stop murdering baby it 's disgusting . the fact people actually advocate to end baby life is disgusting to me . the future generation will see this abortion culture one of the worst atrocity in human history .
i hope u can understand . the elite want your kid a slave to theirs . they do not have your best interest at heart . every three day the wipe their behind with the constitution being constipated from the diet of king .

how long will it take planned parenthood to send for plane to state like texas to pick up girl during school hour without parental consent and wisk them off to the nearest slaughtering state but with the full cooperation of the school ?
the american people are becoming rich and they are forgetting the rule of religion . prohibiting abortion seems to suffocate american citizen . but the american government ha done well .

there is no such thing a `` abortion right '' . abortion is the killing of baby . is bbc a baby killer ? ?
"perfect , the rate of ungerage people in conflict with the law will surely boost the in the next 18 year ."
"we 're overpopulated , human are a virus . many of the people that would want abortion would n't make the best parent . so regardless of when a soul enters a body , we may a well allow abortion . who want more commie in the world , anyway ?"
"so that 's what a woman is , i thought there were no sex anymore ."

it 's nowhere in the constitution ! ! !
"when all of the church in the u have closed down and do not reopen , then we shall have democracy and freedom again ."
revival is coming to america

"abortion wa never a constitutional right and actually violates the 4th amendment . it wa an illegal act by the scotus in 1973 by making it a federal law set right today and set the abortion issue back to the state legislature , where it can be voted on for each state . scotus in 1973 only wa to interpret the law , not make law . and that 's exactly what they did , and it wa a violation of the purpose of scotus . woman have a choice with their body , not to have sex ; since abortion is not birth control . here in america we are giving the lord all the glory for this victory ."

"from the u - we are not polarized . the majority of american want abortion to be legal . we are literally under minority , extremist rule . 6 religious extremist decided today that they do n't like abortion so they overturned 50 year of legal precedent to make it so . edit : they are going after gay right next . and the right to contraception . and god know what after that . this is what fascism look like ."
"why do many american fight so hard to stop a woman 's tragically hard choice on there body for whatever reason they feel it there only option is too end their pregnancy , but nobody riot or protest and court do n't even attempt to try and overturn any of your assault weapon law . im not trying too be rude or disrespectful a im not american so im just simply trying to understand the logic of some mom out there homeless , or drug deepened , raped abused many reason besides a lazy birth control method where a woman keep getting pregnant and just keep getting rid of baby that way is disgusting and should have tube tied but a i wa saying why is there so much passion in your country on the life of a mom it consider evil for her to end the fetus from growing but it almost seems le important to stop a person from killing classroom of child why dont those mom who wanted their baby and just sent them too school not have the support of so many including court too i change that law on assault weapon ?"

"i am pro-choice , but if the abortion will be used for medical emergency , for r * pe victim , or for mol * sted victim that is fine , but to continuously use it a birth control is abuse and wrong . the state ha complete access to contraceptive , why not be responsible and use the provided contraceptive ? it your choice to give into your lust and allow yourself to be impregnated or to impregnate woman ."

okay rape i get it but u woman opening your leg without even thinking ya 'll are dumb
"i 'm not american ( thank god ) , also zero political knowledge but i get the impression that judge are driven by their own personal feeling , opinion and which party they belong to . best interest of the ordinary people of the country take the back seat ."
"it wa never a right , it wa a medical care extended affirmed in roe v wade . which wa later abused to kill child ."
hahaha snowflake becoming responsible .
i surely hope the government will be funding orphanage . woman are going to be going through unsafe abortion . teen marriage and teen pregnancy are going to sky rocket . soon therell probably be a plan b and birth control shortage . this is just disheartening for everyone
"where is the anti surrogacy law , if you are so pro life bear the 9 month pregnancy , do n't pay another person to do it for you .."
"get rid of all the progressive trash that ha been put in to law , get rid of them all and crush the leftist that have almost destroyed the west ."
nowhere in the u constitution doe it say woman have the legal right to murder their unborn child . absolute joke of a news station lol
let hope all the anti-abortion protestors do n't get raped by the family member or a stranger
this is n't banning abortion . in my state you can have an abortion until it 's born . quit acting like woman will be dying from dirty knitting needle .... just innocent little baby .
"it not `` right to abortion , '' knucklehead . why not ? 1 . ) this ruling doe not outlaw abortion . it merely sends it back to state legislature . 2 . ) there is no `` right to abortion '' in the constitution . the word is n't even mentioned , hence this is a state right issue by default ."
thre u fought the taliban just to replace them with their own christian taliban
"imagine a guy cutting hole in a condom , just to trap a woman"
1:21 it 's unfair . she 's pretty safe from abortion .
well played get ready for more religious law passed all the way to sunday law it happening
abortion imo will always be the most political issue while human walk the earth .
"common sense . there is not much to admire america for lately , but credit 's given where credit is due . hopefully more country will follow ."
"cry leftist cry , you do n't like it ? then do something about it . 1000 year of serfdom ha turned europe in to a prison where people have little to no right ."
"by the power of yehoshua ... back off evil doer . do n't come to american or anywhere in the world saying it 's my body then turn back after unprotected affair ... for paid abortion or if you ca n't afford kid get a vasectomy or condom . we are not here for food stamp , welfare , gov assistance , section 8 , free housing , free fund for a child that you can not afford . so ... it 's not your body ! it 's the child 's life and our packet is not paying because you decided to date and screw the rest ! ! ! get a grip ! ! !"
"it 's very upsetting to see this happening . i 'm pro choice and i believe that woman should have the option to have an abortion . but on that same note , if woman have the right to say `` my body my choice '' , i do believe that there must be discussion on what a prospective father ha the right to say a well ( ie : my wallet , my choice ) . with abortion being legal ( a i said i believe it should be ) woman can choose to abort a child , even if the father doe n't want them to . and assuming the woman want to keep the child but the father doe n't , the woman can still have it and get money from the man . so , obviously the discussion of abortion is a topic concerning woman , but it also concern men a well . i agree with this outrage , but i just wish there wa more outrage like this when father ca n't even see their child ( who are already walking , talking , and conscious and where there is no debate a to whether they are `` alive at conception '' or `` a clump of cell with no consciousness yet '' ) due to spiteful spouse and court system that treat men terribly . all i 'm asking for is a little consistency , because , let 's be real , a a whole , woman 's issue get spoken about significantly more than the challenge that men face ( and there are plenty ) , whether it be in mainstream medium or just in our social life . woman and men both have issue , and just because i ask for attention to also be directed at the other side doe not mean i 'm saying take away attention from the other . but i should n't hold my breath , i doubt anything will change . my mini rant is over lol . ( also , i assume most people wo n't read through this unfortunately )"
gop to announce their next political goal : remove woman 's right to vote and property right bring back slavery
"nobody had a legal right to an abortion in the first place , but nothing is being taken away from anyone or being banned . all they 're doing is letting state decide for themselves if and when an abortion would be performed , letting elected official decide for their constituent . in some state for example , abortion will be allowed up until 24 week , and in others they wo n't be allowed at all , but they 're not making it illegal to travel to another state . it 's incredibly simple to not get `` accidentally '' pregnant though if you 're in such a terrible situation that you ca n't afford to raise a child . perhaps this will encourage people to be more responsible , instead of treating getting an abortion like picking up a prescription ."
why are pro abortionist so transphobic ? dont they know men can get pregnant too ?
home of the free
it 's called recovering moral sanity .
it the woman choice not the state !
just have contraceptive man .... such a cheap and simple practice

the pro-choice protester are so uneducated .. the school system and tik tok ha failed them . the ruling is the state you live in make the decision .. most of them im sure live in a democrat state so there going to be able to have a many abortion their cold heart can handle . the american liberal are so anger and lost
america slip back into the 19th century by removing every woman right to self-determination . the so-called pro-lifer arent nearly so bothered about kid getting shot to piece en-masse in school on a weekly basis . a if we needed confirmation that 50 % of american are stupid .
i think abortion is murder and the unborn baby did nothing wrong unless the unborn baby endangers it 's mother life .
still driving around with a huge placard with your name on it sarah ?
"forget about all the other issue common american face but oh no , you just had to stick your nose in people personal life . let see if pro life people will be there for you when youre with a child that you can not care for"
naturally nothing will be done despite justice committing purgury in front of the nation which then turn around and steal right from our population .
bias bbc a always
haahaa ... fuckbunnies ... it 's over .
"and this shit country ha the audacity to preach others about human right , when they have the largest incarcerated population , astronomical health cost for majority of the people , a failing education system , child gunned downed at school , and people so paranoid to carry gun everywhere . now this . well done muarica ."
i 'm encouraged to see young woman that are fighting for the right to life ! abortion is murder ! look at a newborn baby and see if you are ok with anybody ripping it apart or stabbing it in the neck and murdering the baby ?
be good if republican cared a much about human life after birth a before it . what a different country the u.s would be .
i hope we do n't follow this
sex
california allows abortion .
"why is all of this blown out of proportion ? if you feel you want to kill your unborn baby , just drive over to the closet state where it is legal and get it done and live a happy life . i think the overturning it is a good decision overall and every state should be able decide what they think is right in the matter of abortion ."
"they did n't take away a right , the right to abortion wa never constitutional . they gave the right to decide to individual state , a it should be . this is not the job of the federal government , it 's federal overreach . take responsibility for your own decision , the decision to have unprotected sex , when there are numerous method of protection ."
i hate it here .
divided state of ameristan this is all fluff people will just go to democratic state to get one with a whole movement to help them.anita thomas must be celebrating tonight it farcical .
the right to abortion wa not struck down ... there wa never a right to abortion .... the court just said that judge ca n't make this decision and that it ha to be decided by each state individual elected legislature
"the world is tumbling upside down into a terrible abyss . there must be something wrong with society . is it `` culture war '' . poor , poor america !"
move to state that let 's you murder your baby .
"they 're gon na keep fighting for what ? gun legislation to protect the life of kid in school ? healthcare for all people ? the many death and complication from back alley abortion ? or how about proper care for the many , many child in vulnerable situation that they have no control over ? i doubt they 'll give a shit about anything else now . well , maybe taking away other right that have been fought for over the year . what wa is , heard there is talk about taking back the right to same sex marriage ."
"what most people dont know is that baby of 9 month were being aborted and used for nefarious purpose . when you look into the detail , it horrific ."
"dear woman , dear feminist : men have always been in danger to be made a father against their will . in those case , there is hardly any personal autonomy left , if you have to care about a child although you did not want to . woman benefited from the privilege to be able to undo their bad choices/mistakes after the fact , men always have only had the option of contraception . the perfect example to show that woman are extremely privileged regarding the societal empathy they receive . where were all the protester fighting for men 's right of family planning/life planning/personal autonomy ? have you heard , my dear feminist ?"
"well , now safe abortion will only be available to america 's wealthy ... a god willed it i guess ."
america ... de-evolution in practice ...
q is back ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
plus i 'm pretty sure all of them baby 's would still love to have a life without instead of been born
"abortion ha never been guaranteed by the constitution . about the only right guaranteed , would probably be the right to refuse to abort . should abortion be considered a a legal option ... sure . but in 95 % of case where abortion happens in america , there 's no medical or rape issue . there may be consideration for supporting the child after birth , or concern about the hospital cost of giving birth . but that 's unlikely to be the case for more than 10-15 % of case at best . and adoption , or pregnancy center are a thing . and realistically speaking , * the supreme court would have probably considered the outcome of some woman taping some guy ... * _and then insisting on aborting said baby._ * against her victim wish . * abortion on demand , is wrong . abortion on having a need ... that 's something worth discussing . i would point out that if only 0.001 % of all abortion resulted * directly * in death for the mother ... that would be around 800 death annually . and we know from antecedent of situation where the mother to be , dy but it is not attributed to her abortion even if investigation by family reveal probable link . california , for instance , doe n't even report what information on abortion they do collect . let alone try to track the so called back alley abortion that happen in their state . simply put . if people want universal abortion access , they need better & more reliably researched argument for it , than emotional argument based upon the mother 's 9 month inconveniencing . _ ( especially when so called abusive boyfriend 's , are just a likely to coerce their girlfriend into getting an abortion , if not more so._ _i know from story former planned parenthood worker tell , that this happens._ _frankly speaking , it seems more likely . ) _ it doe n't really help the pro abortion argument , that prior to this overturning ... north korea & china , were amongst the few country that could match america 's abortion access standard . * most of the 200+ country worldwide , restrict abortion access in some fashion . * to a greater or lesser degree ."
u.s.a population about to hit big
free contraceptive . free health care . then .
jesus love the little child ! ! ! !
"she said , `` i am sorry i can not kill your baby ''"
you sick ba * * rds lost ! ! ! ! ! ! !
they picked one woman with glitter glued to her face to argue for abortion ( 1:30 ) and one woman with glitter glued to her face to argue against abortion ( 2:23 ) .
if only pro life people put this much effort in the banning of gun across america . i guess they 'd rather take people right than gun
the usa take another step backwards into the 18th century demonstrating even further what a retarded country it is .
i too wish that they were aborted
why do one get pregnant in the first place if you have to go for abortion
abortion is illegal and gun are a constitutional right in afghanistan a well . america is great
it 's a pity an unborn child can not stand up for their right
they all better be donating to orphanage . all of those nut bag .
"i truly wish pro-life idiot would understand the implication of what they believe in . abortion will always happen ! roe v wade made abortion safe and calculated , now america is returning to the old day where coat hook and two day trip to canada and mexico are common"
what about the right of unborn child ? ? ? ? what fault is theirs ?
pregnancy is profit for america that 's all that matter nothing else
"god bless i 'm so glad , now it could be more baby 's born and earth population and united state population can expand"
woman who want abortion will find a way . i expect to see the rise of people who are not medically trained now offering abortion . baby that are not wanted will be abandoned . social service are not funded to provide a safety net for this
we do n't want church in the school and business but you want to take away my right .
abortion is killing by hit and run .
the law never changed ... '' thou shall not kill . ''
i 'm 21 and i 'm terrified ? why ? because you ca n't get an abortion ?
banning the procedure after a certain amount of time ha passed in the pregnancy .... a logical decision and a win for sanity
absolutely love this . ben a while since i 've ben proud about my country .
you have the right . to wear a condom
"if you support banning a woman 's access to safe , legal abortion - you are flat-out anti-american . the vast majority of american want abortion to be legal ( with obvious exception based upon term limit ) . you are not an american if you are happy with what happened today . that is the ultimate truth . we have a lot of people in this country masquerading a `` american '' when they disagree with everything america is supposed to stand for . they hate freedom . they hate democracy . they hate anyone who is not exactly like them . and most of them live in the traitorous south who cost our nation million of life when they rebelled in the 19th century . nowadays , they like to claim they are `` more american '' than everyone else , even though we all know differently . you are not american . you are scum ."
dear police covering riots/protests . give the baby-kil ler a taste of their own beliefs-shoot them . at least they can run and try to protect themselves ...
simple dont want to get pregnant dont have sex
absolutely disgusting .
"they can do something . impeach thomas , barrett , kavanagh , and gorsiche . thomas ha tie with right wing extremist and is unfit to serve . the other 3 lied under oath to congress regarding their view on precedent . alito can stay , but those 4 , got ta go ."
land of the free ? if only they gave a shit about the little child after they are born .
what if the baby wa going to have no quality of life ? what if the mother 's life wa at risk if the pregnancy continued and she already had a child whom she did n't want to leave with no mom ?
democrat you welcomed to moved back to ny and ca
im incredibly happy that people care and are fighting to get this human decency back abortion should not be seen a murder i see murder a if something ha already been born not something that cant even breathe and is leaching off it mother well being
a great day for america . a great day for the unborn child . time to go the same way in uk and europe .
"a an american , my country never cease to embarrass the hell out of me # shameful"
the title reveals the bias of this reporting . that is not what the ruling wa
"i wonder how many of these happy , young woman celebrating here will die because of their pro choice decision ?"
bear in mind that the democrat are in favour of 'abortions up to and including the point after a child ha actually been born ... ! it doe n't take much to translate this into selective infanticide ...
* planned parenthood is a branch of white nationalism and supremacy such a the kkk ! disown and destroy margaret sanger statue ! *
great news amen jesus love all the precious baby
"a canadian , i feel sorry for all the woman right . come to canada"
biden is always on the stupid side

the christian racist taliban is takin
"america is a complete joke to western society , it like their evolving backwards thank god i live in england"
woman being made accountable for their bad behavior ? omg
"this is being overplayed divisively . this wa a correction of a bad law ... all that ha happened is that individual state will be responsible for their abortion law via their elected representative and so democracy ha been improved . nothing stop woman from crossing state border to get an abortion . the decision wa not caused by trump judge at all . it wa a decision based on correct legal interpretation of the constitution by 6 to 3 in favour . the bbc is showing bias in it 's presentation and people are overreacting emotionally . many subtle adjustment will balance out inherent difficulty that are being screamed about and are well known to need addressing , such a case of rape and poverty , etc . 49 year ago the supreme court invented law in contravention of it 's jurisdiction and that ha now been corrected . the democrat are pushing reaction to get vote ... joe biden ( president_ and nancy pelosi ( speaker of the house ) both back abortion very strongly and yet also claim to be catholic . it is completely against the catholic faith to endorse abortion ... so they are both clearly liar whichever way you look at their stance ."
america is the most backwards country on the planet .
"no one ha lost the right to abortion . it may become inconvenient . jurisdiction wa simply remanded from federal to individual state control . jaybee , installed elliptical office occupant is most certainly not a devout catholic ."
"the constitution never gave them a right to an abortion . that 's false and anybody saying that is either a liar or ignorant of the fact . roe v wade is not a law it wa a judicial decision , that 's all . it 's supporter say it 's legal precedence that enshrines it , under that logic jim crow law would still be in affect . it 's left to the state , in otherwards the voter of those state that determines it legality , where it belonged all along ."
so all the left ha is groomers . baby killer . free loader . and rioter and looter on thier side . and they wonder why the left is getting so much push back now day ? hmmhmhmhmh
lol the baby killer are so mad . and thats a good thing
"roe ha delighted sane people , and enraged fanatic ...... xian sharia law is celebrating their hollow 'victory ' o ' telling others how to live - and it will not stop there . goddamn , i thought this wa america ..."
4:10 if he really cared about it being up to the people he would be for legalizing it . but he not so he us buzzword and catchphrase instead
"i am not a u citizen and do n't know the politics either . but i personally think they should have never banned abortion , they need to ban gun totally instead . raise your hand if you agree with me"
shame these pro lifer dont give a big of shit for the child murdered in school shooting .. we need our gun
abortion wa never a right granted by the constitution . more far left propaganda .
"best news ever , thank god . dont sleep around and have unprotected sex and you should be ok ."
gun n bible . what a country .

american woman sleep around too much . what willl happen if woman do not have any lasting relationship and keep aborting baby that are from casual affair ? do n't they know that many society look down on them ? being a superpower is not enough . have family value and take care of your baby .
"funny how abortion seems to be an issue and child getting shot and killed every month , is not . make this country safe for child to live in , first ."
that 's what 's wrong with this country stupid ass like them dumb ass
people are saying `` use protection '' until a woman get raped multiple time by multiple people . until certain detail about the pregnancy lead to the death of the child and the mother . until they start finding child dead due to the irresponsibility of an unfit mother/father . until they see hundred of underage sexual abuse victim die during birth because they 're body ca n't take it . not everyone deserves to be parent .. not everyone planned to even have sex . what is wrong with this country
"this crazy where the world is heading , all thanks to fasist mentality people"

"europe might need to liberate the usa from fascist rule somehow please .i am not trying to overthrow the government , just shame the hell out of republican tourist and ask them why they are so racist and stupid . every time you see an american on the street ask them if they are republican ? and if they are ask them why ? and ask them if they are fascist and or racist .and then tell them to f * ck off . and you do n't need their money and go home ."
"something people are ignoring or intentionally missing out , is the fact that roe v wade wa based upon testimony of a woman being raped which wa later admitted to have been perjury , so it based on lie and a such ha no reasonable way of being upheld in court . stop treating this like an attack , it not . it how the law work ."
"praise god , jesus is the righteous judge and he is coming back , repent while you have a chance ! you wicked people fighting against god , only foolish will fight against god ."
thanks be to god . now charge all those doctor with murder . throw them all in jail .
the shitty judge in the supreme court deserve to be jailed .
"pi $ $ off with your life matter ! honestly it not selfish or disgusting of parent to end up getting an abortion , what is selfish of a human is having a baby knowing fully well that you can not support or raise that child to the best of their ability and potential , knowing that food is short , housing is a struggle or knowing that you couldnt afford school fee or clothing ! all these a $ $ hole fighting this nonsense , remember you live with mommy and daddy ! they pay everything for you and the only reason you have anything on your back or in your hand , so get out of mommy basement and go get a real job !"
"it is disgusting see a `` nurse '' cry because at her place of work , she can no longer murder baby ...... it gross me out"
"woman will use herb and government will try to punish them for it , herb is how woman took care of themselves and were burned at the steak a witch , this is the same thing in modern time ."
pro life . pro responsible parenting .
they have no idea what they 're doing at this point
"men have been treated like secondhand citizen when it come to their child for year . men have had no right whatsoever when it come to their child if they wanted the mother to keep it or not yet they have to pay child support , any custody case men have been treated like dirt . now woman are going to have to learn something about personal responsibility"
"good , we do n't need abortion in america and around the world . how can one person murder unborn child . in the name of abaution .."
this is the best decision in our history . finally murder is elegal

[ 4:171 ] o people of the scripture ! do not exaggerate in your religion nor utter aught concerning allah save the truth . the messiah , jesus son of mary , wa only a messenger of allah , and his word which he conveyed unto mary , and a spirit from him . so believe in allah and his messenger , and say not `` three '' - cease ! ( it is ) better for you ! - allah is only one god . far is it removed from his transcendent majesty that he should have a son . his is all that is in the heaven and all that is in the earth . and allah is sufficient a defender .

religious bigot have overturned democracy . im amazed usa isnt on fire . fascist have taken control
original case wa based on a lying woman who said she ha been raped . good decision .
"the supreme court wa once the last recourse , to excess of the government , but now it enforces the excess of government"
"i understand how people feel but i 'm not fully agreeing with this decision but abortion is like taking someone 's life and that 's a sin , also if they do this the country is gon na end up overpopulated ... and also poverty is gon na be high ."
i do n't understand how people can be anti abortion when there 's multiple situation this could happen in . for example a woman who wa raped and became pregnant . the woman should n't have to carry the trauma through the rapist child . also accident with pregnancy can happen even with contraception . america is taking away one of the most important human right . choice . the u ha gone backwards and people need to wake up that this is unacceptable
"keep turning the clock going backward in time ..... well done usa . land of the free where law are backward looking . when will we withdraw the right to vote for the minority , woman and other progressive law ?"
this all happened because of mitch mcconnell 's scheming and denying a sitting president obama his right to appt judge yet mcconnell rammed through date rapist and the latest a fake 'christian ' against abortion yet pro arms/ oil a code .... prosecute mcconnell 's and prosecute the thomas 's a well a the trump kuschners ! ! ! !
ballot do n't matter when the gop are stealing our right to vote and blatantly stealing election and promoting and funding armed treasonous home grown terrorism .
"repubicans want open carry and push sale ( and drug ) push terrorism , allow our kid to be blown away in public place , church , school , temple 's and at work but they care about a fetus ? ? ! !"
time to stir the pot ... election coming up
god bless president donald trump . i love this man and i pray that he come back to the white house . we need this man in power very badly . use birth control before having sex and getting pregnant . you dont kill a child for the sake of saving the life of a mother who wa careless and didnt take any precaution
"young lady , if you spread your leg to have someone cum in , then you better be willing to spread your leg for someone to come out ."
yeah ! ! ! more tax paying slave for america ! !
all the people of america need to vote for trump and we need trump to go back to his office in 2024 !
thank god . it is about time .
"a a classy woman who been lucky enough to have 6 abortion from potentially six different father , this is a setback for humanity . a a single mother on social assistance after my ex money ran out , im not sure how im going to explain this to my transgender child , this world is so disappointing !"
the baby killer are a salt mine tonight lol lol lol
first off you at the bbc better get it right woman can still get abortion in this country it ha n't been made illegal so the misinformation you 're putting out and the lie stop doing it .
"potato joe biden , you 're not sure what you 're saying , time for your warm milk , and your sleepytime ! you 're a corruption , baby killer !"
"some people are cry , because they can not murder baby any more . the white man ha been methodically wiping himself out in abortion clinic , causing a demographic crisis ."
time to grow up . stop doing drug . use actual protection . im grateful to be adopted and alive .
the motion of a soon to be police state . absolutely shocking
bbc is no longer a real news network . abortion wa not struck down by the supreme court . the decision regarding abortion ha been shifted from the centre to the state . that 's all the ruling ha done
"i guess it alright that abortion are banned , now we can have a backup surplus of kid to stabilize the population when another shooting happens"
"dont worry . hedge fund ceo mistress , wife and girlfriend will still be safe ."
thank god ! the blood of these baby have been cry out for 50 year ! what a glorious day for the sanctity of life
"ohhh btw , what do you brit have any business in our politics ? fuck-off , limey ..."
the left is so accustomed to killing the unborn that it 's normal to them . murder is still murder . god bless the supreme court and donald trump . god will deal with them . the trigger law were in place to take effect a soon a roe wa overturned . abortionist do n't realize what they 've done because of their selfishness . the right to abortion is not in the constitution . it wa a big mistake to legalize abortion federally . ruth bader ginsburg herself said the decision wa ill advised upon reviewing it . norma mccorvey ( the real name of roe ) regretted heavily her involvement in the process and spent the remainder of her life trying to make up for it .
christo-fascists now own america .
what ?
unborn baby s saying .. thank you ... i hope nobody get hurt
america is awful an f 'd up ! they have literally taken away woman 's right and gone backwards . like doe america not understand that some woman do n't have enough resource to care for child . and some are even teenager who maybe not even be ready for raising a child . like this is literally just disgraceful . like bruh !
"god ca n't stand american , why is nobody fighting for middle of the road european policy on abortion . consciousness begin at 24 week and that 's when abortion should be allowed to after that it no longer just `` your body '' but another life ."
your body your choice well take responsibility lady because you ca n't be having unprotected sex with random guy then complain when you get pregnant when you should know your own biology .
the devil is going to be very rabid these day
it is not the right to abortion it is the right to have a law to kill a baby in the mother 's womb
based scotus
we cant kill baby ...... that suck
"it so great ! ! ! ! finally , a win for the beautiful unborn child . thankyou lord"
american are so weird
bbc should stay out of american politics and comment on their own government for god 's sake .
aye agree with abortion if raped but it when woman just get rid of the baby for no reason other than they dont want it it still a living human being .
2:22 im 21 and im terrified well what are you terrified about ? your assignment result ? dumbo
i 'm 14 and i know a lot about life and abotion is wrong baby do n't need to die smh
the decision is correct . the constitution doe not guarantee a right to kill the unborn . it is up to the legislature to create such a law to provide such a right .
"the bbc will probably delete this but the fact is , the bbc have n't done their research and are lying again . the supreme court did not strike down the right to abortion . it simple restored the constitution , which clearly state in the 10th amendment that any power not mentioned in the constitution is reserved to the state or the people . in other word , state make local law ."
".women have been finding way to abort fetus for thousand of year . by the amount of child that are sold into the sex trade , and murdered and tortured by their parent it seems that abortion is the least cruel of them all . there are million of people who do not want to be and should not be parent . there is no birth control that is 100 % effective and abstinence is very rare ."
god is coming back to the heart of america ! reap it !
fake news medium . abortion ha simply been relegated to a state level . it ha not been abolished in the u .
i truly hope they pas the law to ban gay marriage and stop this pride nonsense
"doctor need to stop saying no to sterilization . if you want abortion to stop , then allow woman to be sterilized the first time they ask ."
do they really think that killing is `` healthcare '' ? unbelievable ...
"tragic . i hope this can be reversed a soon a posible . although our society is not perfect and we have so much to rectify , it is ironic that we mexican had gained more right and liberty , a time go by , compared to our northern neighbour ."
how can american care so much about unborn child yet not bother at all about killing their child with gun ?
why the hell people dont wear condom .... right to abortion is same like giving a right to kill a human being .... just because you enjoyed sex and in your emotion you were not able to control .... you should n't have a right to kill someone ..... freedom to kill is not a democratic right
behold the banality of dichotomy
yes ! ! ! ! take that all you leftist genocidals ! ! finally justice ha been served ! suck it nancy pelosi and all the left !
"what a glorious day to be an american ! ! i 've never been prouder of my adopted country ! first bruen , now dobbs . god bless this supreme court born british , proud texan by choice"
6 judge decide what american woman can do with there body is just wrong . it a personal choice for woman not a government choice . it is a sad day for america
give free birth control ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
there is more important thing that need to go or be added but this is a tragic thing to hear another right been removed from the book for woman
"look at the woman protesting at 1:30 , no man would make her pregnant . she just looking for a cause ."
"`` if this is freedom , then i do n't want to be free '' seems pretty apt ."
it like we dont want a civil war but sometimes you wonder if reform and a cleanse of all these old men and the blind woman that follow them would help america be ameroca
why are all these pro-life female activist obese ? lol
this wont affect trans woman a they cant get pregnant can they . it just play time
"absolutely disgusting , disgraceful and vile decision making . the judge should be executed !"
this is unthinkable in the 21 century . every woman should have the right to her decision and not force thing in the name of religion .
"before you could say `` the sanctity of life '' we were knee deep in dog muck , thieving kid , and crusty juggler ."
america finally got a w
"the u ha now returned to the dark age , what wa once a nation of liberty and freedom ha now become a dictatorship of evil cruelty ."
"canada gon na get a lot more visit , what the boarder guard gon na do , stop pregnant woman leaving the country ? probably make me a racist but i treasure all life and it break my heart that abortion is needed , but it is needed for what ever reason . are american birthday rate so low they decided this"
may i suggest the pill if you dont practice safe sex if you dont want a baby take birth control
i 'm just glad it piss off the weird liberal
"oh fuck , so with the combination of the gun law and now this ( abortion ) court case it seems the court are n't only bias it seems that the government an system of the u will collapse . seriously if the u doe not do anything soon to try to fix it 's fuck ups both on national and local it seems that the `` once great nation '' will now cease to exist . now the chance of state leaving the union is at it 's highest in year , if this keep up not only will the anarchy from blm come back it might get worse ."
abortion are not illegal in all u statesit take away government power and restores it back to the state .
"in the u ( a nation where more woman die from complication of pregnacy and childbirth than in any developed country , where hundred of thousand have died in a pandemic from lack of healthcare or poverty , and where historically female were bought and sold a breeder to enrich slave owner ) forced labor is an established national tradition and reproductive right are another example of human right that were never guaranteed for the poor ."
"discarding thinking about genuine failure of contraception ; this should lessen the instance of `` random sex '' in america , a all woman are noe responsible . i 'm going to enjoy watching the youtube video of american guy saying `` ... but my girlfriend would n't let me ... ''"
"again , more mis-information by the bbc . there wa no right under the constitution that allowed for abortion . that is a law by state and no judiciary , in the uk or the u can make law , that is by legislator . all that wa done wa overturn and set right the constitution . the decision wa that roe v wade wa flawed a it meant creating a new right under the consitution , and that can not be done by any judiciary or legislator , law and right are very different . judge do not make law both in the uk or the u . it is still law that state can decide what is allowed , when it is allowed , for abortion . the decision doe not mean abortion can not be done . abortion is not a right under the constitution . the fact is , ending a life is murder and people can try and twist it all they like , it is infanticide and even go back to sacrificing child to mollock . personally , abortion should be outlawed . argument for it are flawed by nature , biology and even science itself . that being said , the state in the u can still make their own law a it wa for a long time . roe v wade is not constitutional and that is all the decision wa , it change nothing on abortion law and those law have always been state level . quote the constitution where it say abortion are a right . you will not find it . abortion are alloowed and state legtislator are responsible for making those law ion those state . i am an englishman who know this so american who do not ? you should be ashamed . the decision doe not mean an end to abortion no matter which side you stand on . the beeb need to stop mis-informing people . so yeah , abortion have not come to an end in the u , beeb are lying yet again . propagandist . get your fact right beeb . the right in the constitution ha never existed and roe v wade could never be right , that wa a state level decision and scotus should have thrown it out then and told the state to make their decision . there ha never been that right in the constitution . if the state law exists then they can have one so what is the issue ? stop gaslighting people . right and law are not the same thing ."
great job u
thank god . sacred heart
american democracy is fraud where holding gun is fundamental right and control over your body is not fundamental right . how can these mentally ill american govt advise developing nation to about democracy whereas developing nation improving a lot in comparison to themselves but usa is going backwards .
this is a tragic moment for america
you a a woman can have the right to abort a baby a long a the man can have the right to not financially support the baby if he request you have an abortion and you decide you want to keep it . a dave chappelle said `` if you can kill it i can decide not to pay for it ''
i 've never seen a country go backwards so quickly without suffering some kind of coup first .
i have never seen so many uneducated woman praise their own loss of personal choice in one video ...
pregnancy should be illegal because the child ha n't consented to being born .
"bbc isnt getting this . the court ha merely said it not a right in the federal constitution , which mean the question go to the state . for some people , they will need to go to another state and get a motel in order to get an abortion . once in a lifetime ? twice ? i cant really imagine getting too upset about that ."
killing baby is not carrying woman
goodbye gay marriage please respect the church
i am happy to see this . god bless america .
"congrats , pro-lifer , now you cheer , be prepared to adopt unwanted baby that is what you get when you make others ' uterus your own business"

all fuel for our coming 2nd civil war . britian 's be grateful you do not live in a crazy violent country with more gun than people .
"i get it , you 're killing someone before they are born that 's bad sure .... but what about accidental pregnancy ? even worse , what about woman who are raped and just want rid of the kid so they do n't have to have that memory every day , that they were forced against their will to have a kid . i am a man myself , so please forgive me if my view are unjust ... but i do believe there 's a few case where you should have the right . obviously people will disagree with this view and that 's fine , we all have the right to free speech , well within reason of course ."
"`` the unborn '' are a convenient group of people to advocate for . they never make demand of you ; they are morally uncomplicated , unlike orphan , they do n't need money , education , or childcare ; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationship ; and when they are born , you can forget about them , because they cease to be unborn . it 's almost a if , by being born , they have died to you . you can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth , power , or privilege , without re-imagining social structure , apologizing , or making reparation to anyone . they are , in short , the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love jesus but actually dislike people who breathe"
coat hanger sale will go through the roof .
great news
"these people act a if these never happened before roe v wade or a if they 'll stop after it . they 've been happening since the beginning of time and will continue long after today . they have stopped nothing . the only thing they 're doing is making it much more dangerous and increasing loss of woman 's life , but then , that 's what they want , the `` pro-life '' pile of fetid feces thump their bible and screech that if you are trying to do this , then you deserve to not survive the procedure . `` pro-life '' hardly surprising that most of these people are religious zealot , using their dusty old pile of paper to justify doing whatever harmful evil they want by pretending it 's `` god 's word '' . but it 's not just religious zealot either , some of them are also conspiracy theorist who think that by forcing people to have baby , they 'll stop the `` great replacement '' , which is absurd since the ban affect the immigrant too , and who do you think are `` knocking boot '' more ? duh ."

"killing anyone including a foetus in the womb should not be part of any constitutional right ! the scream of the woman in the street who somehow believe that ending life is empowering for them just show whats wrong with society ! these woman literally are opposed to what femininity is ultimately about ! abortion should never be a right . human right ( which i support ) is about something very different ! and again ... in horrible bias of the medium show it ugly face right away , these commentator and journalist arent even trying to stay impartial but must berate u with their personal political view ! i for one who ha passively experienced the horror and aftermath of an abortion am glad that the termination of life in the womb of a woman can no longer be celebrated or downplayed with euphemism like abortion !"
"the incestuous abortion that were missed 60 year ago are now making decision for others , what a freak show !"

"from this video , what i am seeing is all abortion are illegal in america . if that is so then the country ha some serious problem . if not then there should be case in which abortion are allowed , such a serious mental illness , rape victim , if the child in the womb is deformed or stillborn , if the mother continues it will lead to death of both or either the child/parent , and any other serious issue . if a female doe n't want to have a child while having unprotected sex , then plan b work fine . abortion should be the last measure a female ha to take to abort an embryo , imo i think she ha almost till 4 month to know if she want the child or not . the partner of the woman should also be conscious and aware what kind of responsibility he is handing his partner with having unprotected sex . he should learn to either use a condom , pull out , or finish with oral or external way . with all the technology available to prevent pregnancy why would people be happy with a last resort , abortion . i do know some people do n't notice their pregnancy until birth but those are rare ."
"today i have never been more ashamed to be called an american , 2 3rds of our country considers themselves democrat or liberal leaning , our supreme court is wrong . today the louder conservative minority won . we can not allow our nation to be controlled by screaming , rageing bigot who think they speak for all american"

"just a note , the vast majority ( like ~80 % + ) support first trimester abortion , and the vast majority ~ ( 65-70 % ) support some second trimester abortion . this is not the will of america ."
why should mother have the legal right to have others expertly kill their unwanted child .

"great news for the unborn , for those that cant defend themselves and for those who love life . to the rest of murder , f yourself"
why did you have to post two video on this irrelevant issue ? the next law they need to pas is castration ( and maybe a forced sex change plus throwing them into men 's prison for life ) or outright death penalty for rapist .
america really is a shthole is n't it ?
glad that the murder of baby in some state will not be allowed
no sex = no pregnancy . the anti-abortion rule really make pathway to the rise of lgbtq in america . you will not get pregnant if you are becoming lesbian .
"this just allows each state to set it own abortion law . abortion isnt banned , some of you people need to calm down . if you want unrestricted abortion including post birth abortion then move to a deep blue state like california or new york . if you dont want abortion used a birth control then move to a red state like idaho , the dakota , etc ."

waitaminnit ! how ... how are the infant sacrifice to the androgynous god moloch going to continue ? how are these marxist in dc going to get their adrenochrome ?
1 out of every 6 american woman have been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime . lot of woman are raped in the u and now they are forced to have their rapist child . these vile disgusting men should keep there law of woman 's body 's .
hat 's off to those people and the supreme court who decided to stop the abortion .... loved it ! ! ! !

"there are of course very sad situation that pregnancy come about and for those my heart go out to . however it 's about time that people took responsibility for the decision they make , if you do n't want to get pregnant do n't have unprotected sex ! ! it that simple ."

"testimony of jeremy thomas robbins : when i wa a young man i enjoyed what most young party going men liked , such a girl , beer and drug . i would have sex with any girl , any time and anywhere . for so long i am not sure how many i have been with at this point . i had little to no moral nor care about anything really . the only thing i held onto wa my word a i wa taught when i wa a child , that a man is measured by his word and to keep your promise . so , if i said i wa going to do something , i did it no matter the cost . that being said , one night i awoke from my sleep . sat up in my bed and vocally promised myself i wa going to read the bible . not sure why , to this day i still have no understanding a to why i made this my word . but i did , so i read .... and read and read more . turn out the bible is a rather large book and it wa taking me some time to do it . but i gave my word and i kept on reading it and a i read it the word where convicting my soul . i could feel something in my heart start to turn and became uneasy . then one night , when i wa asleep . i awoke to a presence in the hall at the end of my bed . i could see something wa there but i wa not able to see what it wa . then i heard a disgusting noise coming from it and i told it . you 're disgusting ! ! then out of the silence , out of the darkness i heard . you are to and it grabbed me . then i awoke not knowing i wa in a dream a the entire dream wa where i wa and how i wa . `` never had a dream like this before and never had another like it again . '' the crazy part .... i still felt right where `` it '' grabbed me , a if the tightness of it grip wa still on me . to say the least i have seen something that is not normal nor good . there are evil thing in this world we can not explain nor understand but i know a true a the air in my lung . spirit are real and so is god . this is my testimony ."

shame on maxine for encouraging violence
"somebody tell me ! what state ha completely banned abortion a the journalist said ? she never mentioned any state that completely close the door a planned parenthood . when did murdering the child in the mother 's womb become healthcare ? woe to those who say right is wrong and wrong is right ! another question , and you fill in the blank . it 's okay to murder your child when ?"
god is pro-life
"the gop ha replaced safe abortion with unsafe abortion . well done , just like how the gop replaced the taliban with the taliban ."
when libs cry i am happy !
welcome canada ! people will go across the boarder .

"america is ful l with b hon . clerance thomas you are still considered 3/5 of a human being according the constitution , you hypocrite ."
i 'm surprised they left the comment on being such a divisive issue . i suspect it 's because the medium are not happy about it whereas they stood for no criticism on issue they supported over the past couple of year .
these morans who are screaming victory are too dumb to understand real implication of this .. they need to work on making life of kid 8n this country better but who care about those
latin america slowly legalizing abortion over the last few year and the u now banning it after having had that right for 50 year . how demoralizing this setback is . make me sad a an argentian after seeing how hard this battle wa in my country to know how hard it will also be for american woman now
yes save the kid ! !
"her body , someone else 's right . the land of the free .."
now how can you sleep for one night with this woman . while you know they will kill your child or you . killer i hate this woman not all of them most of them .
"abortion is not a right in the constitution lol it now mean individual state can set their own law for abortion , like texas ha a heart beat law , maybe more woman will be actually thinking about thier repoduction and contraception more diligently , abortion is not a form of contraception , it the murder of a child"
why wa that one girl dressed up like a cat ?
"people will get angry enough at not having abortion , but when they hear their country is being purposely destroyed a a mean of a great reset to make u all own nothing then it sound wonderful to them"
one question for everyone else equal part of america ... if you observed one man eating human being ... do you want to be eating ... if you want to be eating ... you have a great mental health problem because ... woman genitals are no conch meat ... what are you eating baby ... myself asked ... the man conch meat ... do you want some ... myself go to bathroom to vomiting ... okay woman who want to be conch meat ... in god name amen .
it high time the president increase the number of judge on the supreme court . it the only way to combat the moscow mitchs who is nearly single handed destroying our country .
"abortion is still a sick term but it lessens the horrific reality of the situation , murdering baby ."
"so , the bbc get told about their bias and all i just heard were people cry about their right . not one mention of the fact of the right of the life inside the womb ."
this is so backwards
time for me to leave this country . it doesnt stand for much anymore . hypocritical at best . downright dangerous at it core .
"so america is closing down it killing field finally . freedom to kill innocent baby seems to be one of the reason that triggered self-destruct america we see today , see how it lead to a country without boundary and the freedom to destroy public property and the woke culture ..."
it wa never a right to kill a baby
"i 'm so happy for that and proud of u supreme court , if you do n't want to have baby just be responsible with your body ."
"scotus ha established one religion , which our constitution is supposed to prevent . alito wrote that abortion wa not tradition - but her ha zero proof . so we need to bring back traditional slavery ? ? ? ? ? ?"
hopefully far-leftists do n't cause billion in damage like in 2020 burn loot murder riot .
"due to some family history i 'm not pro-abortion . not because of religion ( i do n't have one ) , not because i wish to control woman . it 'd be a long explaination , but basically i am a `` liberal leftie '' who ha different view on this one issue . but i recognise that this doe n't outlaw abortion , it outlaw safe abortion . woman are going to get desperate and take unregulated medication and even go to back street abortionist who may butcher them . i fear that the u ha just traded one lot of issue and problem for another lot . if there is a god then may god help any woman caught up in this political battle ."
did trump really say that ? we know how to create life so only a idiot would think god play a part . religion is to blame here . there are to many extremist in the u .
"well , if the pro-life woman get sexually assaulted ( or r * * ed if you really must ) , then say they do n't want to keep the kid , then laugh at them , tell them of their decision in this case , and laugh in their face before walking away ."
damn but i do n't really care
finally all this evil nasty woman need to be lock up .
many woman will die ! thanks to the trump administration and these f * cked up scotus 's !
abortion are evil . how you can pull your baby apart in the womb is disgusting . you would n't do it to a dog .
"unbelievable . america is being held hostage by the christian right . abortion wo n't go away . it will go underground and , in the process , become more dangerous . the fact that they bristle about any attempt to introduce sensible gun control regulation but are perfectly willing to restrict a woman 's reproductive right tell you just how pro-life they are n't ."
i used to look at bbc a more objective than other medium until it stated `` right to abortion '' .
"i 'm shocked and honestly devastated for american woman , this is going to pain woman all over the u ."
why are we going backwards why
"it wa n't a right and it wa n't struck down ! they simply moved the decision of legality to the state , where it should have been in the first place ."
"the ultimate freedom , is the freedom to kill your unborn baby ."
"just a reminder to all you biden voter , this decision came under his term in office ."
so condom sale should go up ? right ?
literally going backwards . build a better world how doe she think thats possible when the biggest problem we face is the exploding population . there already to many people on this planet .
the supreme court merely ruled that nowhere in the constitution is the right to destroy human life . i 'm not sure what ground there are to disagree with that
the opposite of pro life is pro death .
every country should allow one mistake . the 2nd should then become a crime .
"the american dream is only a dream , it not real ."
child born of unwanted pregnancy must be state responsibility .
this ruling still allows the 8 state who choose to terminate pregnancy up to 1 minute before birth the right to do so . yet you do not mention this fact ? ? ?
no wonder the population growth in europe is lowest .... yet their stupidity grows in bound and leap .... leave usa alone think about your own country and how to fix your own problem .... idiot
well done america ! ! a step on the right path
"this is one of the idiosyncracies that make u politics lesser than under developed or developing country . there are actual problem world is facing and u is still ca n't decide on right to abortion , right to bare arm , ... etc. ,"
and sad it is they all will end up in foster care but yet no one want to adopt them.even those yelling that it not a good choice
"life is worthless , rat and roach can make life . but making choice , having a life plan , respect , make u be human being ."
yes right now ... but please do n't people understand the situation ... the cannibalism is over american ... because the trade humane for gold ... the gold digger trillonaries using the same thing since we have knowledge of the rapist make woman 's pregnant to give meat to the canibals trillonaries ... get to the bottom of ... the dream is only a dream ... woman have plastic bag in the chest and never can feed the baby ... because nothing is natural anything else is yes a dream ... wake up dreaming people ... amen .
"no one actually understands what this decision is . it is an excellent legal decision . the whole point is that the scotus is not a political institution : roe v wade gave people a right that wa not legislated . if you want a law , such a `` legalized abortion '' then the proper path is to ask you law maker to pas a law , that involves due process . roe v wade had no due process and yet it performed the function of law making . the decision simply deemed it improper and ask that if the public want that right , go and ask your law maker to do it , because the function of scotus is to interpret the law and not making them . and here are people throwing a big tantrum simply because they heard some people saying they `` overturned the abortion right '' when it is nowhere near that case . if you want abortion , vote for it , do n't ask judge to do a politician work ."
time to head to america and rap_ me some woman
"biden is a moran , save the baby , we can not have a society that us violence it barbaric !"
"abortion lead to female led eugenics : it 2055 : `` artificial intelligence analyzing the baby 's dna : .... brrr ... brrrr ... analyzing probability of the baby being over 6 foot tall , looking like johnny depp and not being bald nor over-weight a an adult .... brrr ..... probability : 23 % . woman : `` damn ! well , i guess i 'll abort this one . maybe i 'll have better luck with the next guy '' .... there must be responsibility , otherwise we will be heading towards a society we would n't want to live in ."
"monster , they deserve to be after birth aborted"
why are people so braindead in america
sad yo back to coat hanger i guess
"too many people are claiming the right to abortion is not included in the u constitution . although it 's true that the actual word is not used , it is included in the right to privacy . body autonomy is a critical component of the right to privacy , in fact , which is protected by the constitutionas decided in griswold v. connecticut ( 1965 ) , mcfall v. shimp ( 1978 ) , and of course roe v. wade ( 1973 ) ."
"here 's how to avoid the need for an abortion : stop having casual sex ! if you must have casual sex , use contraception . if you still manage to get pregnant ( contraception fails , rape etc ) , you still have a wide selection of post-coital contraception option ( most/all are free in western nation ) : # morning-after pill # iud ( 99.9 % effective at stopping pregnancy if used up to 5 day after sex ) etc"
no ! the right to murder innocent speechless baby ha been struck down . since when is murder of the innocent okay for any reason ever ?
there 's a lot of inexpensive birth control out there why is n't that talked about .
"the unborn are a convenient group of people to advocate for . they never make demand of you ; they are morally uncomplicated , unlike the incarcerated , addicted , or the chronically poor ; they dont resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct ; unlike widow , they dont ask you to question patriarchy ; unlike orphan , they dont need money , education , or childcare ; unlike alien , they dont bring all that racial , cultural , and religious baggage that you dislike ; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationship ; and when they are born , you can forget about them , because they cease to be unborn . you can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth , power , or privilege , without re-imagining social structure , apologizing , or making reparation to anyone . they are , in short , the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love jesus , but actually dislike people who breathe . prisoner ? immigrant ? the sick ? the poor ? widow ? orphan ? all the group that are specifically mentioned in the bible ? they all get thrown under the bus for the unborn . methodist pastor david barnhart"
should be changed to `` home of the brave '' but still quite a few coward .
"put it this way if you think they truly care about the unborn , charlie kirk a prominent pro-lifer said if he knew a woman who had an abortion he would feel sorry for he . if he truly believed it wa murder on what planet would he feel sorry for a murderer ..."
of course they call them trigger law because that 's what they want the whole right side to have your finger on
do they realize it no gon na stop anyone from having one.just because it ileagal doesnt mean it gon na stop.dont like abortion dont have one
the supreme court just went full order 66 on the libs .
when roe v wade wa passed the morning after pill wasnt available .
"choose life , your mom did ."
there should be better option people should not be using abortion a birthday !
the real dark day in america wa when roe v wade wa passed .
biden is powerless . period .
unwanted pregnancy cause tax payer a lot of money .
my state is new york and any woman who is being forced to go thru with anything they dont want to is welcome here . hateful comment will not be responded to .
expect bloodied coat hanger to be found in ally way in state who got rid of abortion . thats all i have to say .
"every child is a precious and sacred gift from god # president trumpive noticed that everyone who is for abortion have already been born # president reagan .. incomprehensible that since 1973 , 61 million abortion done in the u.s ."
there are very few sane people on either side of the issue . just look at those woman . fyi : this case wa about a mississippi law that banned abortion after 15 week . woman in mississippi can still get abortion up until 15 week . the medium 's characterization of this is misleading .
still the state decides ... so the people of the state decide .. which is still balance and good
"bless the yank , the majority of `` anti-abortionists '' in america using the argument of `` murdering baby '' are the same people who will bite your head off for trying introduce stricter gun law to reduce the amount of murdered baby ..."
good maybe now the std rate will go down
there is no baby for these people to save . the life isnt made yet .
i guess in the case of a medical emergency you can claim the that rape ha lead to mental illness opening a case to perform an abortion . thats just me looking at a loop hole instead of mass riot a this decision went through all the legal path .
only sl * t and manh * e be disappointed .
"it not a if it mean abortion wont happen anymore either . itll still happen but it will be a lot le safe and bad people now have an opportunity to make money from it . and not the first time a u.s. law ha had these effect , might i just add ."
there are enough type of birth control and the morning after pill maybe young woman might be more careful with their body . abortion is not birth control . american woman uoto now could abort a baby right up til the week before it wa due . that should n't be allowed in any civilized society .
this is a great day ! no more abortion ! ! ! ! ! ! thank god ! ! ! ! god bless america !
dramatic ? for who ? ? ? for innocent one por for killer ? ? ?
"this is a decision to let state legalize abortion , what is the big deal ?"
the non-aborted human in the future thank the supreme court . abortion should only take place when the mother life will be in danger if she give birth . terminating a fetus because it will inconvenience your lifestyle is immoral and demonic .
very good . we 're going back to our root in america . a proper conservative country .
great news for usa from these low life creature - enemy from within worst than isi - the demon rat
"the ignorance of the protester amazes me . do they not realize the only thing this overturn doe , is to put the abortion right back into the state ? they can still get their abortion , that ha n't changed . it is still legal in the majority of state , especially in case of rape and incest ."
never go to america .
the sport of killing human a law is needed for the woman .
let the accountability start : - )
"this subject should n't even be up for discussion . i had a friend who got raped when she wa 15 , her parent were idiot like these people and forced her too keep it and carry it for 9 month . when they could have allowed her to abort it since it wa n't even alive yet . she dropped out of school in order to take care of her baby . when she turned 18 her lovely parent kicked her out of their house . my mom let her live with u and took care of the child for her since it wa painful for my friend to even look at the child since they so closely resembled the `` father '' . my friend died in her sleep 2 year ago , she wa only 19. her whole life wa ruined . she felt sad and tired all the time . and wa left with a lot of inguries after giving birth since her body could n't take it . she wa such a sweet beautiful girl . i truly dispise all the men and woman who are `` pro life '' what life are you talking about . it is a fetas . it ha yet to develop . unless the lady is already 5 month pregnant where the child can feel then it 's none of your concern if the she chooses to abort or not . the only life is the woman who is going to be ruined . a child should be a blessing and a choice . not a consequence . these people scream privileged and uneducated . and i wish the pro abortion people would actually bring up scientific fact and people story instead of stupidly shouting `` my body my choice '' . that ai n't doing shit to help anyone ."
"woman say it will lessen the violence in her country , but the gun are fine"
"what will be next ? ? ? same sex marriage ? mix race marriage ? what the f next ? having cop in your f bedroom ? you can only slow down the change , but you cant stop it ."
so now what ? prohibiting gun then blaming on unaccessible abortion ?
abortion should also be banned in the uk it go against the core principle of christianity and judaism and islam but more so .... humanity
amazingly balanced reporting . it is sad that balance in news reporting seen a remarkable .
a a citizen of the u from birth . i an deeply ashamed of this country . it is on a collision course to either another civil war or conservative dystopia . all in all there may very well be bloodshed before the end .
i see potentially high risk of gunless female
great news : )
the u politics is so bizarre . normal thing in other country are polarized and politicized in the u .
this is not about abortion . the ja6 will be forced .
the dishonesty of reporting is scandalous . scotus simply corrected a wrong . roe wa unconstitutional .
that ha to b a complete violation of woman right got to be !
"@ 5:26 you thought this country would still allow you and subsidise your child termination , got it ."
i hope all the s lag and s luts arent too upset
"glad i wa able to help my 15 year old friend when she wanted a termination . i wa her only friend and brother figure , and she needed an adult . only thing we had to do wa travel to manchester because someone could have recognized u in newcastle ."
"this is not really about abortion . everyone is missing the point . it 's about judge that are biased . i do n't know what people expect . you know the judge are biased , and you expect them to make a fair unbiased ruling ?"
when someone get raped and forced to give birth abd they do n't want to have it . all i can say is wow good luck
i wonder if the bbc is the most hated corporation to ever exist ? certainly is mt top choice
no they lost the supposed right to make me pay for it .
a a hispanic immigrant that came to the united stated im very happy for this decision . if people want to have abortion let each state decide if they want to be participant of murderer .
no it 's not . it 's now up to individual state to rule on the subject .
this country is dying
it not a constitutional right ...... your getting mixed up with the carrying a gun law ...... which is an `` actual '' constitutional right
"00:08 - abortion wa a `` right '' ? ? ? wrong ! ! ! the only right that american have are those enumerated in the u constitution and it amendment . american have no other right but they do occasionally get `` favor '' from their master , the social security system being a prime example ."
thou shall not kill ! it 's a commandment that ha been overlooked for a long time . the unborn finally got their day in court & justice prevailed .
this is some taliban 3rd world shit .
america is the most divided place in the world ... in my opinion .
do america know how much of a meme they have always been to the world ? what a backward place .
"i wonder if there 's a statistic that show how many pro-lifer in usa are also nra member . oh well , look on the bright side , more kid mean more target !"
"now , u supreme court force american to stand with taliban together ? u supreme court is trying to prove the power of a religion over law , just like taliban ? this is unbelievable . this is making u a barbarian land . so shameful ! it is not other country beat u down . it is u itself drag itself behind the world ."

"these comment are disgusting , my sister would be dead if she didnt have an abortion you animal"
"get your molotov ready , my boy . it 's time to burn some judge 's mansion ."
strange that country which is so hyped up on 'freedom ' allows unelected official to make decision that impact million of people .
"the report wa bias . noone wa shown celebrating their choice to keep . no mention , some people abuse roe v wade , to use abortion a a last ditch contraception , due to unprotected sex . i dont trust non-official statistic on how many u woman choose to abort during their lifetime , but a safe bet will be 10 % . i would believe among those maybe 10 % were due to rape , medical , or other trauma . let say 9 % overall used it because of unprotected sex . this is acceptable to keep it legal , to me . however no mention that some people believe much more abused it . i found stats claiming it is a high a 30 % instead . i know pro-choice and pro-life issue is so loud mainly for ideologically , political and religious reason , not on moral one . actual argument for and against on moral ground , matter le , and used a tool instead . the fact , this is kicked back to the state , where abortion can be legalized one day , is n't a emphasized relative to how bad that it wa overturned . mind you the scotus issue , is not abortion legal or illegal , but who should handle this , if the abortion is a constitutional right or not , not weather it is criminal . this report wa bias , pro-choice . no judgment , maybe for them it wa impossible to represent both side equally . i am protesting unfair representation , not the ruling . dont know there , my flavor for today , pro-choice constitutional , but i am not against letting it swing , if it wa legally done . being fair to some in their perspective , in this case , will be unfair to others in theirs ."
"@ 2:21 im 21 and im terrified use condom or other form or contraception if you must , that should do it : - )"
"good it changed . lot more men an woman now will practice safer sex . no brainier , make me happy this news"
"so misleading and one sided it unreal . if you know the fact . how about it un done many year of a unconstitutional overhaul of the legislative process in the state , now the power for people to make choice is back with the people to decide when life begin is a decision for the people . trying to claim abortion is a god given right is ridiculous . if california want to keep theirs law so be it now red state if they choose can change their law . not so much for freedom of choice when it other people choice ."
i bet the communist bbc is sick a about this . i personally dont really care ..... but the more lefty and commie and bbc staff hate the news ..... the more i love it . i 'm literally amazed the bbc dare keep comment open ....... how do you keep up the pretence you are impartial when all your commenters hate you and everything you stand for ? imagine being part of the bbc ....... the most pea doh file supporting organisation to have ever existed ...... who the statue of outside the bbc ? scum bag and you all dont realise how hated you all are
"the united state of america . or a we soon have to call it : the-country-that-must-not-get-laid . thank your grandpa 's in the supreme court , dude . they just drafted you all into the permanent friend zone !"
"british medium reporting on u news like we are a u state , please stop it just embarrassing . they follow the american like a lost dog"
"the democrat have deployed national guard unlike on jan 6th when although trump/pence had made 20,000 national guard ready the democrat wouldnt deploy them because they wanted a riot ."
who wake up thinking about other ppl pregnancy and abortion ? ? ?
this is the greatest news the usa ha had in decade ! finally the 55 % of american who oppose abortion will be able to decide their own state ' law on the subject . history will remember this the way it remembers the ending of slavery and all of it `` less-than-human '' argument .
keeping leg closed is usually a good thing to do or take the pill
abortion is wrong
hahahaha ! ! ! hahahahahah ! ! ! i e never seen some many lunatic in my life . woman still have the right to choose . to choose to keep their leg shut .
and im an englishman no way this should have happened woman should have every right to choose period !
"i thought america wa a free country ? clearly it 's not a good a they say , im moving to japan"
all the anti-abortion activist in the video are fat and ugly woman . i wonder why .
"how about birth control pill , day after pill , and condom ? ? rape is practically the only time the female ha not all these aid to keep from conceiving . if a woman doe not want to conceive ............... i sure a hell don t want to be born to her . even when they think they want a kid ..... they usually f up . and that is when they are not sadist , pedophile , etc ."
thank you my dear heavenly father
country who wanted to change the status of woman 's right in afghanistan .... lol
there will be violence ....
congrats american !
im living in massachusetts and this ruling doesnt apply to my state . we will still having abortion . conservative can go f themselves .
right to abortion is like a right to cut your finger off if your finger get broken abortion is wrong
"keeping legging closing , save life because while you take up a hospital bed getting rid of a life that might want to be here -- the bed you take also deprives a sick person that want to be here . ? -- just a thought ."
if the two side could just respect each other i think that would do a lot . it not murder . it 's not just a parf of a woman 's body spare 14 day embryo in ivf clinic receive no sacrament ani implantation contraceptive `` morning after pill '' are available over the counter in some state . it is obviously the woman 's choice - a it is her risk a brit
love our supreme court ! this will teach people to be more responsible .
i invented gilead . the supreme court is making it real . margaret atwood .
trump still at work .. a win for life today .
"the bbc should n't be aloud to t port on their it 's like this a they do n't report the truth , and just feed u democrat bullshit ... no one should be a ! our to about a baby when it 's almost due to be born !"
now they can adopt all of the kid that will be born into poverty .
"go back to california , also give california back to mexico"
a disgusting country .
so is this good or bad ?
this suck
"perhaps they do n't want to cancel abortion , only fix that old ruling that served a a platform for wider right of woman . hope i 'm not mistaken , but now they can start a completely different procedure , giving back abortion right to woman based on plain scientific fact . that could n't ever be overruled because science doe n't change with time . but first science must make it very clear there are no other people living inside a woman body ."
it a sad day that the unborn child cant be slaughtered ( joe biden )
they care about baby life and at the same time not do anything about kid being killed in school make sense
"we need to support the right to choose abortion for woman . if parent can not support their baby , then who support ? i do not want to see child neglect . it a fact . right ?"
america further becomes a sick joke .
"while the supreme court decided abortion right , our planet secretly wished for an extinction event ."
lol what a great country hahaha mad day ahead
"so now you will force american woman to have baby after they have been raped ! gangbanged ! abused , incest baby that are born deformed from mixing family genetics from abuse will be forced to be born ? are you crazy america ? have you judge gone simply wacko ? ! have you opposition not got any screw in your brain whatsoever ? what about woman that are raped by serial raper , serial killer baby that could grow to be serial killer and raper themseleves because of passing over hereditary genetics , omg what a bad decision you guy made today !"
the bbc is creepy .
"finally ! the libs rant it `` my body , my right '' but what about the right of the baby it `` his/her body , his/her right , his/her life '' abortion is murder of a baby , a human child ."
"im obviously pro-life but this is bullshit , people are being stripped of their own right , what if a woman wa raped ? oh you have to keep that baby and communicate with the father ( rapist )"
can you stop obsessively reporting on the u . it 's not the uk
it just went back to the state you dumb ninny .
excellent news .
"so ... a bunch of old men just decided american woman have no right to their own body any more ? sorry usa dude , you ca n't hang with u first world country any more . forcing chick to have kid is not cool and soooo third world country . respect your woman a fellow human being , brah ."
these people pick and choose their religious sin what is tolerated and what is not look in the mirror before telling a person what to do with themselves
"in china , an unborn placenta is not yet identified a life , it 's just mother 's property and the mother ha the right to give up the property , which is her freedomif abortion would endanger the mother 's life , then no hospital would perform the procedure , because the right of life is first ."
woman that travel from one state to another to have an abortion is nothing short of premeditated murder .
"the `` pro-life '' crowd are the same people who would deny asylum to desperate people fleeing warzones and abject poverty , they 're also the same people who want to allow unstable teenager access to assault rifle , and they 're the same people who support trump 's immigration policy , tearing family apart and caging them . they must think were stupid if they think they 're fooling anyone into believing they care about stranger unborn child . to them , this is simply about attacking feminism , upholding `` christian '' value , and winning one over on the `` libs '' . that 's how petty and backwards these people are ."
"so if a woman get 's raped and get 's pregnant from that , she will have no choice but to keep it even if she doe not want it . so much for a free country ....."
it hilarious these prolife also promote pro death by expanding gun right and minimize restriction . expect a 60 % increase in orphanage & abandoned newborn too .
"everyone must vote for representative that support woman 's right . since they threw this issue to the state it is up to u , the voter ."
based . fuck leftist and fuck child-killers .
"this comment wo n't go down well every day in america more & more extremely young child are treated like trash & abused & murdered by their own parent so that 's where quite a number of these unwanted child will end up i 'm sure the rest , after yesterday 's ruling on the second amendment upholding american right to keep feeling & thinking they look macho due to the fact that they carry a concealed ego in their holster which mean they are in control those child will probably get wiped out in the wave of mass shooting that is inevitable bunch of hypocrite"
"repent and believe in the lord jesus christ , for the salvation of your soul ...."
the fucktalibans of occidental country . this is not the end - respect to all american woman who gon na start a hard resistance against this oppression of their fundamental right .
"abortion is not a human right , it 's murder period ."
i love child and all people . i am so grateful for the result determined by the supreme court . i believe in human right . this protects the human right of the unborn child .
1 in 4 pregnancy 'self abort ' . for these religious extremist doe that mean their god is an abortionist ?
for such a new country not 250 yr old . to actually force someone else 's recent religious ideal onto non religious ppl is no democracy . recent ? coz did n't the nun used to abort teen pregnancy ? for all we know they probably still perform these on convent girl now ..... holier than thou ....
"100 year behind civilised society , including gun law"
"it look like the bbc doe n't understand how the u constitution work . the supreme court ca n't and did n't make abortion illegal . it simply said the constitution doe n't protect it a a `` right '' . that mean that each state can put it to a vote . this is called `` democracy '' . right are not put to a vote , and nowhere in our constitution is there a `` right '' to an abortion . if a subject is not stated a a `` right '' than according to the 9th amendment of our constitution it is a matter for the state to decide by voting . this is why the u is a constitutional republic using democracy to settle matter the constitution doe not address . read the u constitution . it is a very short document , and no where is there a right to abortion . the word doe not even appear in it . this is where democracy play a role in our constitutional republic . in california they 'll be killing their kid right up until the age of 18. in texas killing your kid will be illegal . that is how a republic work ."
hallelujah for the unborn baby ! !
typical bbc . so biased and one sided . it is heartwarming however to see so many prolife comment on here .
slut got to stop slutting i guess
whats next reversing woman right ? ? america is so tapped and backwards
same people that whine about too much government . they have taken control over female health . the power of a few over the many . everyday our freedom is fading in amercia .
bbc bulshit again all 50 state will still have abortion but will have a time limit state can vote who are in charge out so democracy rule you can go to a different state to have an abortion these people want late abortion up to time of birth
notice all the people a gainst abortion you would not fuck any way ? just have the baby and drop them off at the prolife hq ......
lol what a looney bin
what a sad day in america all because a group of men
usa is a theocracy - so much for freedom of religion
"man this look like a south park episode , unreal .."
"to the woman who said she 's terrified '' do you feel helpless , do you feel victimised , do you feel like your right have been taken away and your voice silenced by a higher authority ? well you 're in good company because i know thousand of unborn baby who know exactly what that 's like , if you dont want a baby , dont have sex ! '' to the woman who said were gon na keep having botched abortion and die a a result . `` your basically saying we are gon na keep illegaly murdering people until one day our victim kill u '' i would really struggle to feel sorry for you in that instance ."
you may not like what they take away from you next !
"it will come down to each individual state having it own set of value ; america wa started a a republic , not a democracy . food for thought ."
this is messed up
"roe v wade also made legal , contraceptive and contraceptive education . these can both be banned buy any state now . company who market these product , and health care facility that provide advice or there product are now criminal in america ."
is n't it funny how the left all of a sudden know what a woman is after this ruling
it simply mean the state control abortion .
good if you dont want child put a johnny on it
canadian will help american woman we already said . you can come here and get a abortion anytime . you will have to pay but at least you can get one here do n't worry .
sorry you ca n't kill baby some men ca n't even have any
the supreme court did n't ban abortion . bbc doe n't understand how the u.s. system work .
now we need to fight to ban same sex marriage
a victory for human .
"they kept their gun law , yet they lose a right to abortion ? crazy usa"
it is a shame to see such a modern country act so pathetically with regard to human right . they base their constitution on their being oppressed but do no more than oppress their own people . so you can not abort a child even from rape but we are fine with a teenager owning handgun and driving car but they can not drink until 21 they allow tv evangelist whonprey on the weak and poor and are ok better than thief themselves and then without checking anyone can own an assault rifle . what a ridiculous society
"they had to cheat the system , lie and become hypocrite to get it done ."
handmaiden tale in the usa
america is dusted
i agree ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
"arbotion clinic : im sorry maam , we are not going to be able to murder your unborn baby today . we are sorry for any inconvenience caused ."
"america land of the free unless youre poor , female , non-white , anti-gun or atheist ."
people you better pay close attention . the prison camp wall are being built getting aid from the supreme court . they just made a moral decision . not a legal decision . that 's not their job . this need to be looked into . this is a warning shot . first in many . in plan to rewrite other law to their benefit . all in moving america backwards . no regard for the majority wanting this law to stand & what 's brazen is they knew what the majority wanted & carried this out anyway . little side not for you guy out there . your fucked now . do an oops and your life a well a the girl is really fucked . advise ? for your sake get a vasectomy . you could get stuck with a woman like who 's interviewed here . god the mental immoral minority are yelling through a megaphone .
great news !
praise god how awful that they want the right to kill their own child
the mostly peaceful riot will start soon
i thank god for this awesome victory today . god is good
more life more money more wife
"woman applauding a return to a bygone age of oppression and no right for woman now they have no control over there own body . only in america , whats next ? cover your face walk 6 foot behind your man . never say no to rape ? it coming because it america the land of the free but only if your male heterosexual and of course white and wealthy . sick country"
the best news in 2022. god bless united state of america . abortion is murder .
"section of the u of american love to kill , by hook or by crook . by all type of gun murdering the young 'uns , if not before birth , then before they see earth . woman supported by the men causing impregnation , to have pleasure and without any procreation , better a justice to the unborn give the couple sterilisation ."
"well this mean they can change the gun right , right ?"
american politics need an overhaul . the system is broken . first you have the trump fiasco and now this . maybe they need to adopt the westminster system . hard to call what they have now a democracy for the people . come on guy sort it out .
"master tip : i now understand why my childhood friend said woman that believe in abortion are unfit for marriage and should be for recreational use only . if a woman is so heartless a to murder her own child , think of what she will do to you when you no longer serve a desired purpose . it simply a good v evil and light v darkness spiritual battle . how can any moral person justify demanding the right to murder someone with impunity . what a shame ?"
"yes this horrible . these baby will now be birthed and immediately start carrying gun provided by the scotus ruling ! thesis baby will be wanting payback because the birthing person wanted to abort them but scotus ha put a worldwide ban on abortion . gang of newborn baby will be roaming the street of america armed with with ak-47 , s and ar-15 , s looking for the new chest feeder that reluctantly brought them in to this lawless world !"
the majority of woman who get abortion do so because they got pregnant by not using protection . or just not having sex at all . i understand why woman who have been raped are upset . those have my sympathy . but most of you need to learn responsibility .
"the problem that arises from more million of american a refugee from the failed gop state -- like for california that handed joe biden 5-million of the popular vote , that he did not need to win california -- is that it entrenches the disruptive power of a death-grip on the country , that the republican hold , by way of the electoral college system . the majority of american , a appealed to by joe biden , must give the democrat the commanding majority in both congress and senate , with which set thing right . if they refuse to do that , this 2022 and 2024. the u is on a daytona-fast-track , track , to becoming the former democracy of america ( fdoa ) under trump ( or similar ) , like the former democracy of afghanistan ( fdoa ) that trump handed over to the taliban ."
"almost 50 year passed before the supreme court of america can see beyond the cloud . now you get it , change ha come to america ."
"for the united state , this over turning of roe v wade , continues the rocket sled ride back into the time of ignorance and cruelty . i see this dilemma a a woman 's issue , it 's best left to them to make a decision that primarily effect them . no exception for pregnancy resulting from rape or incest fly against the tenon of a descent and supportive society . drawing on religion and the word written by ignorant , ie primitive middle eastern desert dweller in a world we think of a being enlightened yet ha no humanity for others , american pray a lot , cast judgement on other people , yet whose military is responsible for wickedness so egregious , so vile , that even god will deny you all entry to the heavenly kingdom where most of you are certain exists . what a dreadful country , only jungle slum dweller seek mass entry into satin anteroom on earth . y'all deserve what you receive and this is n't looking very good for y'all right now ."
"stupid rule , woman should be able to make decision on what happens to there own body . american are mental ."
"america land of the free unless youre a poor , female , non-white , anti-gun or atheist ."
wa this not prompted by state like commiefornia legislating for termination 24 day after delivery . . tell me if i am wrong .
"every idiot out there for those of you who abuse people with condition , when much applies to you , you will not be helped , for you bash people with condition then get one yourself . this ha nothing to do with the american dream to that of life is uncivil or perverse . and for the government to be involved to force pro-life people and blame republican is unacceptable when they took up the case to choose to that of they had the house through a corrupt mean . if it were up to the president though he argues in the case of woman , it would be used a a ploy to score political earning point for democrat that turned the nation upside down or divided it even more . the fault is the democratic took it up and yet the high justice made their decision with clarity and hopefully not politically motivated tough confused some people by their decision . why are people so committed to murder outside the womb and by that , i mean woman - aside from the fact they did not want the child ? they should think about that before they think about sex is what others would have thought to that of the vital heartbeat bill is important to determine if the baby is functioning or alive . if so , it give people the right to choose rather than to sacrifice for intentional murder then , so life is justified or somewhat satisfied . though i mean there should be a limit of time to get that procedure done anyway ? - they forget to include that rape and incest is a matter of abortion right a well and it doe not explain this validity of right or wrong in the constitution but amended . to it ha to be the morale of humanity is screwed up before the face on both side . one to argue for life and the other for murder . in this case i would claim give the baby to the caring mother and not that of the one willing to have life and kill it . - an ancient example that time forgot . though i have to admit , this is actually good to teach people a lesson about the abandonment . - by that i mean people who continue to give birth and persecute on a purposeful mean . what the democratic of idiot in the government to the president do not understand to a point is that it should have been chosen by the state to begin with , to that of the lady should also have a right to choose based on case-by-case scenario in defense of whose body it is - referring to the lady 's want . so technically poloski in one case is right and wrong . this is actually a step forward for what is right for the life of others to that of also a blow against those of anti-life . it should not be up to the state to pay for illegal abortion or intentional murder . it doe not advocate for murder but to justify for life . so , i am unsure if this statement applies knowing i do not know the case too well ."
"overturning roe v wade simply move the issue from a federal level to a state level , the amount of hysteria in these comment go to show that many people do n't do any research when giving their opinion ."
let 's wait for all these peaceful protest
realistically ?
"this title let me know bbc is mega left and heavily uninformed , abortion now isnt banned it just controlled by the state nevertheless killing baby for selfish reason is morally wrong and a sin"
"let 's be honest . the majority of people who want abortion is not because of the welfare of the baby , even though that 's what they are preaching . it 's because so they can have sex without the worry of giving birth . it 's about them , not the baby .. it come down to desire and their lust . i would say perhaps 5 % of them ? and i 'm being generous here , would probably do the abortion for the welfare of the baby ."
"what 's the point u having a president/leader again ? doe n't f * * * ing work doe it , he ca n't do jack shit by all account , unless you mean endanger human life in afghanistan , then he is your man . of course he did n't make that decision either ."
please do n't come to california jesus freak ......
"arkansas law protects the life of the mother ? wtf ! she should be forced to carry even if she dy . why is her life more sacred ? if the law wa fair it would let her die , put her on life support and the baby delivered when viable . all men who rape should get the same sentence a the mother who ca n't choose abortion - life imprisonment . father who abandon their child should get the same sentence a the mother forced to birth and raise the child - life !"
it is understood better from a female put in that position .
this will teach irresponsible female to be wiser with their body . dont have unprotected sex .
based .
"it should never of been in the constitution you idiot , p it now in the public legislator hand where it should be , abortion is not ileagle , the people of each state can now decide"
those woman who are against abortion have probably never heard a story of a rape victim . that 's just one example
"what 's the difference between an infant and human adult ? size , development , dependency , and mobility . what 's the difference between the fetus and an infant ? size , development , dependency , and mobility . hmmmmmmm . scientifically , when doe a human being life come into existence ? when the sperm meet the egg forming a zygote and a complete unique set of dna down to each individual cell that will stay that way for that human being entire existence . what is the definition of murder ? the intentional killing of an innocent human being . abortion : the intentional killing of an innocent human being ... god bless america . god is smiling upon u today and i am proud to say i am american ."
yes yes yes this wa nonses from a woman
these awful pepole need to learn from mother theresa
life won ? long live gun !
"the 9th amendment state : '' the enumeration in the constitution , of certain right , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . '' this mean that are human right that are acknowledged , but not stated in the bill of right and that the constitution can not be used to infringes upon the right of the individual just because it 's not explicated stated in the constitution . the banning of abortion at any level of the government is a clear violation of one 's 9th amendment and 14th amendment right that promise equal protection under the law ."
sad day for woman . people should probably care more about the actual kid being murdered in school and stuff but sure change this law instead
"lol president biden think that letting the elected official of the people decide their own rule and regulation is extreme . yet forcing all state to allow the mutilation , dismemberment and discarding of helpless human being is totally not extreme guy ."
"abortion should be legal , the unborn baby is not a citizen of any country after all and it should be accessible to all woman ."
"i can understand the religious stand point these people have and i can respect them for having that opinion . but from a sociatle standpoint is awful and disgusting , a well a ruining life but also halting scientific research , simply vile ."
"correction : oversight allowing infanticide , an egregious crime that 's suddenly become trendy , to be legal patched by u supreme court . only good thing it 's done so far , everything else ha been garbage"
before i formed you in the womb i knew you ; before you were born i sanctified you ; i ordained you a prophet to the nation . jeremiah 1:5
"very sensitive subject . to me if someone cant or dont want to have a baby , let them make that decision . what good for the baby come out and got throw away , got mistreated , or got killed . best advice i have is if you really want to have abortion then go to other country ."
praise the lord .
"imagine if these people actually cared about child , how much better my life would have been . instead religious nut just told me to pray a i suffered a an unwanted child in care ."
why are they focusing on the right of the woman and not on the right of the baby ? it not about woman it about the baby
girl at 2:20 - `` i 'm 21 and i 'm terrified that i ca n't have sex with random dude without any consequence now ''
"if they could do it in 1973 , we 'll be fine in 2022 , ca n't wait to see their face when it 's federal again . hold onto hope ."
"christ came for the sinner , not the righteous . for the righteous find your own way ."
i 'm not an american but i 'm glad innocent unborn american baby will get their fair chance at life .
so from now on people are forced too be accountable .
the u is just a messed up country . it a fact . and to think theyve been trying to feed u for decade the non truth fact that they are the `` beacon of democracy and freedom of the world '' ha !
imagine in the uk if the county council decided you suddenly could n't have an abortion . federalism is nut !
abortion should be nobody damn business except for the woman and her healthcare provider . everyone else need to stay the fuck out and mind their own damn business . stop shoving your belief onto others . abortion were banned before assault weapon . usa is on a downfall thanks to republican who voted for conservative leader who then voted conservative justice onto the supreme court . this is beyond disgusting and a clear violation of woman right .
"and just like that , magically , left wing extremist liberal suddenly know what a woman is . you can only stay that crazy in the head for so long ."
next impeach biden
"on the nyse , coat hanger manufacturer stock are going through the roof ."
"excuse me young woman use a condom or abstain , murdering baby in not a right"
i think it only fair to give the decision over to the state . the federal government ha too much power .
"im just watching the same right-wing extremism that tried to steal an election , flood the street with gun , ruin the environment , and now they 're forcing woman to have child they cant raise ."
nothing ha been taken away from any u citizen ! that is not what this decision is saying at all .... it is simply stating it is not for the federal government to decide on the matter .
a a woman i can confidently say that there is no such thing a a right to kill your child .
"democrat shriek `` my body , my choice '' but not when it come to the vaccine !"
just move to a state that think the way you do . problem solved .
there 's so many way woman can stop getting pregnant these day . the coil the pill and condom and not having sex unless you want a child because that is the purpose of sex . why after all of these choice a female/women/xx can still kill a human is sick . take responsibility for your action not life !
"and if we can accept that a mother can kill her own child , how can we tell other people not to kill one another ? -mother teresa"
get the fact ....... they just turned it back over to the state to make abortion law .
trump 's justice finally did something useful .
i wonder if the usa supreme court will overturn american woman right to be a person ?
there will be an epidemic in 'dumpster baby ' .
the constitution doe not say abortion is a woman right
lmao the libs are melting
"you keep thinking that america can not become a worse theocratic cesspool , then it manages to sink lower . biden need to grow a pair , appoint 50 new scotuses by presidential order , get this immediately overturned , then impose term limit on scotus , and impeach every scotus who lied during their selection . and while he 's at it , can he please lock his treasononous predecessor and his partner in crime up , along with every person currently working to subvert democracy , then remove the ridiculos presidential pardon power in perpetuity , especially the mean to give proactive pardon . but we all know he wont because he 's both spineless , and part of the same rancid , corrupt system , and he want to protect his own pitiful interest ."
absolutely horrible ! the government ha no right to control our body !
disgusting bbc `` reporting '' . abortion is not a `` procedure '' it is murder of innocent unborn baby . ave maria ! protect the innocent from evil .
"it took me a few hour to digest this decision , because i had not really thought about it because i dont really care . but now i feel relieved that the abortion issue can be decided state by state . because when it wa a supreme court ruling that wa like tyranny . said every state had to let woman have abortion that wa too bossy . now each state can vote , and each person can live in a state they chose . i think this is great , and woman should stop whining ."
"this is the most important day in history that protects the unborn and their right to life . god is more powerful than satan and today is god 's victory over satan ha finally come to fruition . this slaughterhouse nation - backed by planned parenthood - ha murdered 60 million baby for 50 year - people who could have been our leader , scientist , teacher , doctor and contributor to society . with today 's victorious ruling we finally bring everyone back to their sens and fight for the freedom to live not die by a planned parenthood butcher . the slaughter of our nation ha gone on too long and all the femi-nazis have drunk satan 's jim jones koolaid convincing them abortion is health care which is a lie - abortion/murder is good which is a lie . the aztec and myan civilization use to throw their baby into boiling oil to sacrifice them to satan - abortion is the same ritual to honor satan and now it ha come to an end . praise god"
is n't this all over the vast majority of the world changing how they view terminating a life and when ?
more woman 's need to move to north korea maybe they have better right over there .
it 's great news to hear that roe v wade is being over turned . it 's about time you stop the killing of the innocent . i here a lot of woman and girl say it 's my body my choice yes that sound just about right from a sinner who doe n't know the real truth about what they are doing . it wa the almighty god that gave you the opportunity to be born and to inter his world but you ca n't see beyond your self-centered wicked heart to show mercy to the unborned . woman ha always wanted to choose what is not right for the family it started in the garden of eden the great rebellion yes i know you do n't believe it but it is true even if you die not believing any of it.it still will go on with are with out you . there are many woman and girl who have chosen to do the right thing and show mercy to unborn.but there are still many spiritual blinded daughter of the almighty god who have chosen rebellion your reward will come faster than the wind and in that day you will call for mercy but because you have not chosen wisely there will not be any for you in your time of trouble . roe v wade is a tool used by the devil to kill a many unborn a possible to stop the plan of the almighty god but it have never worked . he the devil tried to stop the almighty god in the day of old egypt when the pharaoh 's of egypt wa killing the first born of the child of israel to stop the almighty god 's plan but it did not work . so if you are one of those who want abortion you 're working for the devil.even if you do not believe this devil exist he the devil is working in you every time you decide to kill the unborned child.your murderer by the almighty god standard .
"the way pro-lifer were speaking , they sounded frustrated with the state of the country and are channeling their frustration to abortion . some people were saying that banning abortion would bring the usa back to it former glory and to being a great country again"
that mean million of woman will have to think before they have sex.women need to wake up .
it should be up to the woman if she want or need to an abortion not congress ! ! ! ! if they are so worried about life why wa the aid and corona virus released on purpose and do not forget the twin tower ! ! ! ! ( world population control ) more of our right gone ! ! ! ! ! ! it is getting like old germany no right for the people wth
"the democrat have held commanding majority in both the congress and the senate and could have legislated this problem out of the way . but it wa politically safer to kick that can of a third-rail , hot-button issue into the long grass of the scotus . will the real republican of maga suffer any consequence this november 2022 and for 2024 ? ? will the democrat judge walk out and leave the scotus inoperable ? ?"
how about you stop having sex with anyone you see . have some respect for yourselves .
right to life protected by supreme court
"the overturn of roe just mean the decision go back to each state . so if you live in a leftist state like commiefornia , ny , etc . this wo n't effect you - you can still kill your baby . calm down . research the detail , ignore ignorant headline and celebrity screeching on twitter ."
"we exist in time ! to understand ourselves mean to reflect on time . to understand time , we need to reflect on ourselves . the book your brain is a time machine by dean buonomano , he state that your brain reacts with the passage of time and establishes bridge between the past , present , and future . if someone throw u something to catch , we move our hand to where the item will be in the future . we plant seed to grow crop in the future . we invest in scientific research so that in the future it will result in knowledge and technology . this being between past and future event is central to our mental structure . from the book the order of time by carlo rovelli . what i get from this is that the evolution of the brain from before the cambrian time to the present around six hundred million year , this is how the brain function . what is happening today in america is that the majority of american homo sapiens are not connecting the past with the future . they just want to live in the status quo of the past , becoming stagnant , never creating knowledge or learning . their past is a white supremacy state with racial divide and a fascist state in which some dictator tell them what to think and what to do a they sit on their couch eating barbecue , watching sport and reality tv show . the only future they are interested in is the next sport event , reality tv show time , and reporting for work . to them it 's a crime to have education , critically think for yourself , and question authority ! proust in his novel remembrance of thing past state that reality is formed by memory . which is so perfect in american society today ! false memory constantly given to the people by propaganda channel like fox news , oan , epoch time , breitbart , and other radical right wing fascist channel are creating this nightmare of a reality we face now ! this stagnation is the death of american democracy and america ! other nation will advance in science , medicine , education , and the art . while america degrades into warring village and state . hint ! study the islamic empire from 1000 to 1400 should open anyone 's eye . the insurrection and reversing roe v wade are just the beginning ! end"
"i think it should be legal for this doctor to kill the baby . but we live in a democracy , and now each state can vote on how they want their state to handle abortion . and if one doe not like it they can leave to a state they like ."
"so much drama and emotion , how exhausting ."
abortion is crime
bbc = british brainwashing channel
you do n't need to screw america . america fuck it self
"it not about a woman 's right to abortion , it about a child 's right to not be killed . this should encourage more people to take precaution and unless their life is at risk then they have no right to kill"
"see the next time some american tell u they are the land of the free ..... ram that right up your arse , free if your male and that 's about it ."
i feel so sorry for woman in the usa . next they 'll have to cover their hair .
i wonder if abortion should be authorised by the given circumstance and not to gender ? i.e with men right
"`` separation of church and state '' is paraphrased from thomas jefferson and used by others in expressing an understanding of the intent and function of the establishment clause and free exercise clause of the first amendment to the united state constitution which read : `` congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ... '' let 's ban religion too ."
wow the democrat have n't been this angry since we freed their slave . it gon na get crazy this weekend .
just put contraceptive in all tap water . woman who want a baby can drink bottled spring water . problem solved .
today 's decision of overturning roe v wade is a no-win situation for everyone because everyone loses . it 's a thing of yet to come that is not in a good way .
"the f'ing medium strike again . it wa never a constitutional right and there wa no amendment adding abortion to the constitution . abortion is n't illegal in america , it now up to individual state to decide , which is how their constitutional republic system work . weed is illegal at the federal level in america but individual state have made it legal , same shit , different day ."
this is amazing ! ! !
maybe not the best country in the world but the most crazy for sure .
"yay , save some baby !"
can we ban religion please ?
it is a poverty to decide that a child must die so that you may live a you wish . -mother teresa
"and this is why the rest of the world watch the u with popcorn in hand wondering which aspect of human right they will play the uno reverse card with . this law is forcing woman to do 'at-home ' abortion leading to unnecessary death . this wa proflific in europe for year and changed like what , 50 year ago ?"
"it not making it ilegal at all , it up to the state to make it legal or not . there are state that allow abortion up to 8 month of pregnancy . thats scary"
the true is . govermemt know that without baby . there will not be a america in the future . just like japan and china now . all the govermemt around the world is doing whatever they can to make a much baby a they could for their country . without baby . in 50 year . you left with 2 option . your country either going to be run by immigrant . or everyone thats over 80 year old .
three principle of successful genocide 1 ) dehumanize the target population 2 ) elevate the killing by looking at a 'higher ' good 3 ) hide the evidence
lol . it got the bbc into a panic !
america the land of gun care & health control
feminist can rant and rave all they like .
the world now wtf
about time
"yay ! congrats america .. your right have been shut down . land of the free and and all that .. that now mean fuck all . your free to be told how woman are denied the right over their own body . well done very progressive . to the woman affected by this , i am deeply sorry .. and i say this a a man ."
this is truly awesome
this mean more single mum . more child to adopt and orphanage . more underage mother .
the reason why these people exist is because they were not aborted .
perhaps a greater use of contraceptive ?
woman should have the right to there own anatomy my body my choice i 'm antinatalist against bringing kid in to exsitence having kid is worse than murder
"the bottom line is that restricting abortion will lead to : more single mother who are not financially supported by the state sufficiently , greater birth rate of child with disability - also consider woman who were alcoholic or drug addicted prior to getting pregnant ( that could have been previously tested for and aborted ) , more young woman unable to go on to college and be independent , miserable upbringing of unwanted child especially those with disability from parent who take out their frustration on the child a they see it a ruining their youth or independence financially . it really difficult to end it when there are definitely good reason for it . i am sure even a pro lifer wouldnt want to have the child of a man who raped her ! this should be a personal choice between a woman and her doctor but set within a definitive time line . and woman who abuse abortion having had multiple one ( 3+ ) should be sterilised ."
just like in all other area of life our right are being removed one at a time .
protest dont work . now it time that we start spilling blood
"woman have the right to do what they want with their body ! ! wrong ! when a life is conceived inside the womb , then it not only that mother property , but it baby 's property a well a it 's dad 's ( sperm donner ) property . it like an embassy which is located in host country , but ownership and responsibility are shared ."
never met one person in my life in my country the netherlands who wa against abortion .
america is looking like a third world nation
"america . kill your kid and let in more illegals , you know , the people who might vote for democrat . might ."
did nobody read freakonomics ?
im literallyshaking.right.now
"just to clarify thing a the bbc are liar . 1 , there is no constitutional amendment that say abortion is a right . 2 , this doe n't make abortion illegal it just make it a matter for individual state . i 'm actually personally in favour of abortion being legal but with a limit of around 18 to 20 week"
"if you do n't want a baby , stop having sex . it is simple ... god be praise ! ! !"
"i truly believe that until a fetus ha been grown for 24 week , and can survive outside it mother body , it is not a completely separate life . it is a human soul tethered to it mother body , and she ha the right to choose how she proceeds with this part of her life and her body . whether you like it or not their right do not outweigh the health and sanity of their mother . late term abortion ( post 24 week ) should only ever performed for serious medical reason . woman who are having late term abortion are only doing so if their baby will not have any quality of life outside the womb . it is unfathomable for me how any politician let a bunch of narrow minded ideological driven so call justice of law can believe that they understand more about a woman health , and survival , than the doctor caring for her ."
did n't mind when they were telling people they had to have the jab . fuck off bbc . how about telling the real truth about the grooming gang ? ! lying by omission is still lying !
"only go to show . your 'rights ' depend on the whim of some old decriped lawyer . one day it legal next day it 's not , following day it 's legal again ? that is not a system that is anarchy ! not based on safety or science , but simply that is what they want now . no nation can endure being run at the whim of people ."
it okay to shoot kid but not remove a bunch of cell
back to the stone age
"america is slowly turning into gilead from the handmaid tale , next they will be turning woman into cattle"
i guess they need to look at interracial marriage now and see what clarence think of that right
bbc libtards playing the game
lefty scum are in complete meltdown and it 's glorious
"i am sorry but if they wont start rioting and setting building on fire , nothing will change . how many time have `` peaceful protest '' actually done something ?"

thank god legalised murder ha been reversed . there is hope for america and the world .
and i always thought they were a liberal and advanced country like i saw whem i wa there ... i wa completley false ...
human right ? woman right ? what about the baby right ?
a civilization that literally begs for and celebrates the killing of it future generation is a major sign of a dying civilization .
"over half the population supported the bill and yet it wa abolished , yay democracy"
kevin mccarthy is a pig . his district is full of homeless people . pro life till they are born then thought and prayer right ?
no they do n't have the constitutional right it 's controlled at state level
it a big victory ! : )
"how can killing baby be okay ? we killed million of baby since 1973 , how can we say that other country like saudi or china have the worst human right when u ha killed million of baby . what a hypocrisy ."
i can not believe those nurse were cry they ca n't murder baby anymore
people should stop minding other people 's business and mind their own . individual have individual need . health and safety should be our first priority .
so it 's down to each state now . traveling to other state is legal ( if they have the fund to do so )
if i killed a pregnant woman i will double homicide but a woman killing a child they call it an abortion people are crazy af
usa is falling ..... glad i do n't live there .
"it wa never a right guaranteed by the constitution , forefather of american never gave woman the right to kill there baby . democrat never tried to make it a law ."
"if you want just any guy baby , then adoption should work just fine"
"so who decided this in the supreme court , a bunch of men or just cranky american woman ? or both ? what the hell is happening to america . it full of psycho ."
up to 9 month it wa legal . how can you say that 's not taking a human life ?
im not sure america is a real place
"the majority of the world is shocked by the rank hypocrisy of the `` land of the free '' where you 're not even free to control your own body a a woman ... where they 're `` pro-life '' but could n't give a shit about the mother or the child once they 're born & where only 11 % of child in the care system get adopted . where they wo n't even control gun to stop child from getting slaughtered ... but do n't forget , these people are `` pro-life '' ? ! you 're an outlier a a developed nation without universal healthcare & where severe illness or injury can bankrupt you ... you have comparatively minimal worker ' right & now the religious extremist are removing freedom from others they have zero intention of helping in any way shape or form . it 's disgusting . i 'd recommend all the woman & men who stand against this , see the state of what their country is & is becoming , & leave . i 'd like to see the state of their economy & country when all the educated & non-religious extremist have left & benefit other country ."
"this is what democracy look like , we vote in preisdents who place judge on the supreme court who reflects his voter view . abortion shod have never been a right , it a privilege and now that it is defederalized each state will now vote on keepin it legal or not , so state wont be forced to offer abortion in which go agasint there value and other state can still offer it if they wish . this is what democracy look like . america ha always been pro life . this clip doesnt say that the u.s wa one of only 7 country in the world which includes china and north korea to offer abortion after 20weeks and even 1min after birth . this is not american value ."
more church b trying to control people choice
the usa is so religiously retarded . it wa always going this way . religious fruitcake win the day . god bless america .
now they will be more careful
you can not stop abortion . you can only stop safe abortion .
"`` are expected to do so . '' i see riot , civil war or a coup happening ."
"ahhhh the usa , where someone 's right to own a gun is seen a far more important than a student right to not be shot by one , and the religious nutjob far right pride themselves on removing the right of anyone they do n't agree with a far a the `` land of the free '' delusion , jim jeffries said it best ; `` in holland , you can smoke weed in front of a cop while hiring a hooker , and you have the nerve to think you are the land of the free ? ''"
"we want all kind of abortion to be banned everywhere in the u . those who want more abortion can leave . next is lgbtq marriage . we are going to ban it all . america is god country , we wont let this idiot destroy it with woke agenda"
5:50 - do your job . we do n't need your opinion .
making it illegal will not stop people doing it . it will force them to do it under unsafe condition and will cost many young woman 's life . it is hard to believe that this is really happening .
gay marriage next
maybe like pushing idea on child people should not have taken this so called service so far while medium lie about stats and what is really going on around abortion i find the timing of all this quite coincidental roe v wade gun right union striking economy crashing war looming funny how history is repeating just like it is scripted
when religion is in charge of your vagina and other reproductive organ
"the british need to follow the american lead and try to get abortion right revoked . every human life is precious and ha value , born or unborn ."
"the supreme court need to be killed all of them , evil horrible monster"
it a shame social medium & mainstream medias behaviour are driving the u backwards lately . i am confident it wont last . you should probably comment on fox news feed if though if wan na reach out . youtubes algorithm have a lot to answer for
wtf these religious people are so delusional and have no semblance of empathy for other human ...
if u do n't want kid why have them ?
listening to left-wing feminist ha been a total disaster for western civilization .
right to abortion ? ? ? ? ? ? there is no right to an abortion under the american constitution . get some education
2:39 do n't you mean birthing people
fuck them they better adopt some of those poor kid in the system if they really pro life and take care of all of them and not complain about it but what do they do nothing about those kid in the system just care about those unborn baby . shut up and take care of the poor kid there are right now .
if woman who are sexual assaulted and can not have an abortion then the person who also created that child should pay for the child it is unfair for woman to go through that alone
those same moron will be banning contraception next .
woman still have four option - abstinence/contraception/motherhood/adoption . thats plenty .
make the world a better place what a joke they just want the woman to go to private clinic for abortion so they get more money
about time the evil of random abortion wa challenged . god only know how many soul never made it
bro that lady with the face paint ha an iq beginning with a .
if we really cared about child in our nation we would have banned assault weapon but no people want their god damn ak-47 instead of protecting kid
pact up and move to a democrat state ! ! ! ! point blank and period ... or go see your doctor and get on some good birth control ! ! ! ! that is before you lay down with the scum ! ! ! ! !
"life won today ? what about the woman 's right to her life ? pro life usually end when the baby is born , and the mother get no help . i wonder how these young woman will feel when birth control is banished . the taliban is here in the usa , disguised by judicial robe ."
i do n't kniw what u wrong with them i wa part of the now thus make me angery and a lot if woman are going to suffer and die because of this my body my right so am suck and tired . or other people telling me what i can and can not do a a woman
great victory for the constitution and basic decency .
"so woman can go get pretty much free abortion but for those woman who have trouble getting pregnant and want a child it cost outrageous amount of money . ya in certain case like rape or incest the woman should have a right to an abortion but for those who just go out having sex and have had multiple abortion , well better strap up now ."
"a a capitalist country it only make sense they would do this , they need more people who are going to be put into horrible situation that will work the job no one else will at close to nothing in term of pay ."
stop sleeping with anyone saying you look beautiful today
stop aborti
the funny thing about conservative praising this is that the majority of these baby will grow up to vote liberal . it like turkey voting for christmas . we wont see the real effect for 20 year or so but it will happen .
great
and most state in the united state they 've got six week to get an abortion i do n't understand why they do n't think that that is n't enough time to go and murder a little baby when in new york they allow even post birth
"spa = when i wa a mere child although supremely wise , there were only 4 thing that i could not over-stand = here r 2 = abortion & homosexuality but now than i am gifted with supreme enlightenment i have come 2 over-standing the reason & the why the creator gave it living creation the magic/creation want of vagina and penis = so the question becomes = if the creator gave i life and the abilities/magic to give or take life ? then tell i who or what religion , government ha the right to trump the gift/abilities/magic given to i by i creator to chose or not to chose that which i do onto i own self , even 'taking my own life ? personally for she who ha aborted could never bear sun or moon for i not because of a wrong or right = simply because i know the chi-effects associate with said action but at no time should i or any human being be so stupidly demoniclly audacious to think that their idea of how i , a an adult human being , should trump my god given right to chose that which affect my body of mentally or physically in any way , whether wrong or right . woman with men should replicate , black life matter with a more power and effect 'women life matter ' = it 's a great time and season for this act of true american ideology spadotcoms.com"
i bet everyone of those who have been fighting to take others right away have never known a hardship
i wonder if all the people cry out to stop people having a choice are helping all the homeless and foster kid in the country a well .

are these anti abortion nutjobs happy to accept and raise all these unwanted child a there own ? fuck no .
america ... land of the free ? i wonder what the definition of free is over the pond ...
this is an awful decision implemented by a man ( trump ) who wanted to break democracy . this is a sad day and i feel for all american woman who have lost control of their body .

george carlin .... who would to fuk these anti people anyway
"excellent . life is short and precious . people should persevere and show a sense of fortitude . plus there are other option for this example of this hypothetical woman e.g adoption . besides the point made , there is a greater choice of choosing not to murder ."
"land of the free , lady and gent"
impeach the catholic taliban masquerading a supreme court justice .
"your headline is a lie , abortion is not a constitutional right . you got to watch the bbc , you can see a little socialist contamination . journalism ha went downhill in the last 5 year ."
you can kill an intruder in your livingroom but you ca n't choose to have an abortion .
"so let me get this straight from the uk , the u do not allow woman to have a right to choose whether they can abort or not but gun right are for everybody to choose ? just trying to keep up !"
this is some 3rd world stuff going on . it reminds me of how woman are treated in the middle east .
people choose to have a unprotected sex . end of discussion .
"`` right to murder baby struck down by u supreme court . '' ( actually , it now go to the state ) ."
it 's just gross . and so are the people who say this is a good thing and the scotus should keep going . let u be a reminder to the world - this is what happens in even a so-called first world nation when the religious zealot get control of the political and legal system . move over taliban - there 's a new caliphate on the block .
all the court did wa recognize it wa always a state right issue . democrat can still kill black baby but only in democrat run state .
"what should happen now is that woman that can not keep their baby for whatever reason they think they cant keep them , should be left at a church and they have to pay for their education , safety , and make sure that he/she is successful and loved since they fought so much on jesus name , that should be a law actually . abortion will not stop , these woman will be butchered , and they call themselves the greater country in the world . do something about your politician u people or they will deep fry you and eat you ."
this is good news day for babies- if you disagree with that statement then youve got to justify to yourself why the right to life doe not extend to all human being !
"for those of you celebrating in the usa , the american taliban is coming for you next ."
disgusting that country is going backwards ..
that woman being interviewed at the start on a personal level - how is it personal if youre not the one getting the abortion ? how doe it affect you if someone decides to get one ? thats what i ask
these feminist cant rely on planned parenthood anymore
this decision is up there with dred scott v. sandford a one of the worst decision ever made by our illustrious scotus ... not to mention their recent gun right blunder ... what a bunch of educated ignoramus !
"u woman now have the comfort of knowing that they can be forced by their government to act a a living life support machine , even for their rapist child . if you think that 's moral , you have something deeply wrong with you ."
the people who scream pro life are probably the same people who believe they have the right to shoot someone in self defence and the one shouting my body my choice when they were asked to get vaccinated . i feel to sorry for the people in america
i have no idea wtf is going on anymore . a a white man just leave me alone and we will be fine .
1 good thing in the past few decade that is coming from usa
"i know what happens next , scotus will ban men from masturbating . technically sperm is life too , they shouldnt drain and kill them , they have right and freedom too lol"
it ` s funny how hard woman will fight to have no accountability for their action ... now maybe they ` ll start actually taking that one pill a day to assist in not getting pregnant during a tinder hookup ...
"i agree with ruling , abortion is actually murder , you might say it only an embreo and it not human `` yet '' i think they are completly wrong . if it is not aborted it would have grown to become a person and a human is a human from the moment of his conception till the day he die . this is my personal opinion and since we live in a free world we can all say our opinion !"
the world is over populated already and the world 's resource are running out so basically fuck the planet with no abortion we all die sooner a a whole
"surely whichever side of this you fall on , this is n't good . it 's the same issue that the u had in the 1930s with prohibition and the ongoing debate about legalising drug . the cat is out of the bag and you ca n't get it back in . if woman really want abortion they will get them , legal or not . seems to me all this will do is lead to a sharp rise in dangerous backroom abortion ."
awesome ! ! ! ! thank you jesus christ ! ! !
"did n't this ruling come in a week ago ? geez , bbc , report in a timely manner , eh ?"
"there wa never a `` legally enshrined right '' , there ever wa a `` right to an abortion guaranteed under the constitution '' . it wa never in the constitution , or the bill of right . the original argument to abortion wa a privacy right , which made no sense at the time , and continued to make no sense . a better argument would be bodily autonomy under property law , but even then , it 's not only your body the decision effect ."
"people really want to be able to kill baby , if you 're pregnant then it 's no longer just your body is n't it ?"
new york is keeping the right to abortion . it believed that many woman will go there . at least some woman will be saved from the back street abortionist of the last century .
thank you lord for the supreme court . god is the one who ha last word ! ! ! amen
celebrate good time .
"quantity over quality , america just want more of everything ."
this is a woman 's decision not the government 's .
abortion equal abomination
imagine wanting to control someone else 's body
"i thought first world contraception is available , why wait to be pregnant"
if i were a woman i would probably start useing condems and date men based on how hard a worker they are and i would start useing sexual discipline 80 percent of men get rejected and go into their 30 virgin if men can go with out sex so can wemon
6:09 yeah stop bullshitting the majority of the time it woman just being irresponsible
"welp , i do n't live in the u.s. but i think they should n't have been bowed down to . they think they 're right but this is wrong ."
go trump ! he wa really thinking when he made sure those three judge were anti abortion .
"the pro abortion group is all for bringing child into this world to stand back and watch him starve to death . they call that christianity . sound like pure evilness . these woman who are pro-life , they have been beaten down to where they do n't think they are human any longer so they are against all other woman who ha right . that they have allowed their preacher or their men to take away from them , by putting them down . and brain worsham to believe that pro-life is the way , when it only really allows child to go hungry in the united state because they do n't care about them once they are here on earth . if that 's what they call christian . i would n't want no part of it sound like pure evil . they claimed their christian , but they violate their own belief . their belief are only for others they want to have control over ."
keep your leg closed and it wo n't be an issue . problem solved ...
"god help u . the most disgusting thing to happen in a civilised nation in a while . every person deserves the right to choose , why ban abortion ? it is choice you dont have to abort , you choose to . anyone who say that abortion need to be banned is a disgusting , low - life and ha no idea what this mean on a larger scale . choice is important . you made yours and i hope it is your last ."
"all pro-lifer have now one reason to shut up . live in a state that doe n't allow it if you do n't like it , and vice versa . simple ."
"it 's good , people are realising slowly that there is never an ideal time to face the responsibility of parenting . and it 's just part of the journey of maturing and growing . and for men to discover both how to lead and how to respect and follow , in turn . leading to order , and civil society . the reason why immigrant , are succeeding and taking over in many case , in the uk and europe and usa is simply they have family value and still follow tradition that westerner have been loosing . and good for them they deserve that success for following a natural superior way of life . ultimately people are going to have to make more sensible choice . i just see lot of spoiled child in every shade of the rainbow whining about how they want to have their cake , puke it back up , and not get fat . if you get my drift . this is very good news for black america . the democrat will very gradually loose their grip on the vote of welfare dependant block of african american community a by default they face up to parenthood and create more family unit . the ultimate opposite of what blm want"
anyone who is pro abortion ha no right to criticize the nazi .
i am more curious why is the bbc not covering the money that these abortion clinic make for profit from killing these baby . because easily over 90 % of abortion are not medical emergency period .
whats next ? legalise slavery ? usa is now a third world country
"cope and seethe baby killer , cope and seethe ."
what a stupid country . their power is going . here come china
what a shame that woman cant kill their kid any more . such a shame for world peace and love
"how can we talk about the right of a fertilized egg when we do n't care enough to see that every child is born into a stable , safe , and nurturing environment ? rebecca warner"
slaughter the ignorant parent not the baby that did nothing wrong ! ! ! ! ! !
do n't they know there is such a thing bith control . roe v wade wa based on a lie from the fbi . the aborted baby industry is a very lucrative biusness . a lot of the so called elite are going to be losing a lot of money : ) )
why is the uk getting this rubbish ? this is a yankee issue .
"did n't go far enough you want a baby and government hand out 's you have to give a full clean std screening from both the mother and father , mind you all these pro abortion people would n't even try to get pregnant if this wa a law ."

"usa showing it true color , no freedom , no choice a prison . i am glad now everyone worldwide know . usa is not a free land . gay right next !"
woman should have the right to choose wtf a for the religion comment dont get me started religon is the root of all evil and if god actually excisted he wouldnt be killing people all the time so dont even bring god and religion to the comment
"the only thing you can do is avoid moving to red state , or leave your red state . sad day for liberal ."
"a great day for humanity . a bad day for irresponsible woman , baby organ seller and adrenechrome consumer , oh and the lefty libtards too ."
"emancipated u woman ! u should be grateful to your dearly beloved , mr. donald trump !"
"this is so wonderful . no more killing of innocent baby . how evil ha our society become to think it 's acceptable or moral to kill a baby . no , an unborn baby is not a fetus it 's a human life . thank god this evil law ha been overturned ."
"this is so multifaceted . people can use method to not have unplanned pregnancy because abortion is immoral . but in instance of rape or when pregnancy threatens the life of a mother , she should be able to choose ."
im sorry but all those tho wanted abortion to be illegal your all fucked in the head what if some poor girl get raped and get pregnant because of that she now can not get rid of a child that she never wanted and wa forced to have
this is for the child of the world . the life of those child who have died are what we are honoring . just think of all those soul who have a future now .
really good to hear .
state right f ' k the fed
"according to the bible : `` righteousness raise up a nation '' . a great tribute to the supreme court of the usa . by the way , let 's do a little analysis together : there are about 354 million people in the united state , let 's say there are 150 million woman who are able to procreate , let 's say about 30 % have an abortion every year . so , you could say that u infanticide kill about 45 million child every year ."
great news
"a usual the bbc misreports the fact . this reversal doe not make abortion illegal , but mearly put the onus back onto the individual state , where it belongs . yes there will be a few state that may outlaw abortion and even a few of those will have exception to their particular ruling . most state will have law allowing abortion and if the state you live in doe n't allow the type of abortion you want , you can drive to another state to get one . the pro-abortion crowd destroyed themselves when they started pushing for abortion that would allow baby to be killed after the baby were born . sound crazy , but the discussion wa out there ."
conservative : desperately protect the law that have made shooting school age child a national pastime in the name of freedom . also conservative : cheering that they just lost the freedom to control their own body .
"according to the bible : `` righteousness raise up a nation '' . a great tribute to the supreme court of the usa . by the way , let 's do a little analysis together : there are about 354 million people in the united state , let 's say there are 150 million woman who are able to procreate , let 's say about 30 % have an abortion every year . so , you could say that u infanticide kill about 45 million child every year ."
"so in the matter of a few day that extremist kangaroo court ha made it even easier for american to keep killing each other and now theyre insisting on woman birthing child whether they want to ( can do ) or not . i have u citizenship but will never , ever move back because it become a sham democracy with politician picking their voter , an elected unaccountable king they call a president , it violent the like of which would be unthinkable in any other developed country and it a dystopian society with all the worst part of capitalism leading to such incredible wealth for a few and such poverty for million without even basic healthcare . it is a shame the most powerful country ha become an example of how not to run a country but for the rest of u in the west , we can separate ourselves from being too closely linked so their twisted vision of religious supernatural nonsense and bigotry do not infest our society . child & the elderly should be able to ride public transport without fear and go to school without passing through metal detector , woman have a right to decide if they are ready to have a child , human born gay are still people , people with a different skin colour are all the same under the skin , and everyone ha a right to believe in whatever god ( s ) they want to or not without having it thrown down their throat by the state . these are basic thing any developed civilized country should be able to guarantee without question . sad day , especially for american , but also for the west in general because our most prominent member disgraced itself so spectacularly ."
this thumbnail is very misleading to people who dont live in the u . a an american who wa born in 1993 i can assure youthat the future is not anti-abortion in the u & the majority of young people are outraged by this .
"the chinese government like information control ! delete user , delete comment ! now let 's learn from the chinese government ! delete putin related information throughout the network ! just like the chinese government did to me ! putin want the right to speak , but we will not give him ! delete putin 's content in the same way !"
in many state it is still legal
"well done , iam moving to u !"
"abortion should be legal to anyone who want it , but to ban abortion completely even in instance of rape is barbaric . wait until you see ; instance of rape will increase , but report will decrease . anyone who get pregnant through rape will be reluctant to report it , a that will mean they 'll be known to be pregnant and therefore cant get an abortion . these law are not prolife . they are pro-rapist , pro forced birth , pro maternal death . pro lifer do nothing to help with the very gun law that kill the baby they are forcing afabs to have , or the formula shortage ."
"it 's nothing about pro life . because if it wa they would be taking care of the one that are already here on earth that are breathing air . but instead they pretend like they are pro-life just to watch the child be born into property , and no right a a human being in united state of america . this people who say they are a christian , but allow child to be abused sexually , and be starved to death . if they are so pro-life then why have they took care of the people who live on the street that are homeless and hungry ? because it is not about their caring heart , it 's about church 's controlling the people of the united state . church need to be made to pay tax . because they have violated the agreement that they would not get involved in politics which ha been nothing but a lie , to the people of the united state . church have continued to shave their false belief down everyone 's throat . the bible wa wrote over 100 year after jesus christ wa sacrificed . and the one who wrote the bible were nothing but men who wanted control of others . they have took jesus word and twisted them for them to be able to have control . if there wa a election today between trump and god guess who they would vote for ? trump . because , religious christianity believe that trump is their god . they are led by a false prophet , they say they go by the bible . but if that is so . then why . are they worshiping trump a their god when that is clearly printed in the bible but that is considered a a false prophet ."
"america is becoming the new north korea . the uk is not far behind . we the people need to rise up and stop this take over of our basic human right . the bubble is about to burst , or maybe putin can just start firing nuke at u , end the misery of the west ."
"good news . now it time to ban gun to under 21 year old , implement universal healthcare , free college education , greater tax on the rich 1 % , and no more foreign invasion ."
"there are already many child in foster care who get treated so poorly , why would you want hundred to thousand more to be treated like that ? even after being adopted and being of legal age to be out on your own so many teen get kicked out and left on the street , at 14-17 many of them end up doing drug or getting pregnant on the street , or even raped by their foster parent .. hell even death . are you going to adopt and feed the hundred of `` baby '' that would 've gotten `` murdered '' to give them the crappy life thats already set out for them ? this just scream the unsafe way woman will try and get an abortion , even if their life is at stake . pro-lifer make me sick . i 'd rather die than bear a child i did not want to have ."
"this wa easy to foresee . the trump court will rule like this for at least a generation , but for the 8 million lazy , smug democrat who stayed home because they knew hillary would win ."
america is already populated not even more people smh
men may start buying more condom now . hope it scare then now a much a woman .
what 's so bad about a baby ?
"what a stupid decision . . clearly there is more money to be made in raising a neglected child then there is to save a life that likely wont get the necessary love , support and upbringing to raise a level headed human being . woman should majority of the decision to birth a child or to end it . it is their womb at the end of the day that creates life ."
it 's a pity they overturned it but it 's not guaranteed by the constitution . this is a common misconception . and the flimsy construct put together by justice blackmun back in 1973 is the reason and the tool for today 's scotus decision
"it wa never a constitutional right in the true sense , 50 year old mistake"
what ever happened to separation of church and state ?
finally some good news from u
surely a simple gestation period threshold of legality is all that is required a a compromise .
for this decision to affect woman 's right you first need to be able to define what a woman is
sickening decision and just a sickening to see criminal conspiracists like kevin mccarthy gloating about it .
this is absolutely devastating for american woman . a setback on epic proportion . im so sorry that the system ha let you all down !
this is scary
yet they still think they live in a democracy .the country where you cant say what you want and cant do what you want with your own body .
murder is wrong . controversial i know ....
"very good to hear , a step in the right direction ."
"the scotus gave woman the right to choose to live outside of state with state sponsored child murder . do n't worry lefty , you 'll still be able to murder unborn child in half the state of the u ."
just look at this pro-abortion crowd . what are they woried about ? the only way that these hag will get pregnant is by artificial insemination .
people who are close minded or extreme will never be right whether they are pro or anti abortion . in this day and age it hard to understand how there can be unplanned pregnancy in the first place . there may be good reason for some abortion but we shouldnt be backing abortion for convenience . people need to be responsible for their action and make better decision .
"dr. willie is a clown who got embarassed like a schoolgirl on jesse lee petersons talkshow , nothing but liberal sob story in what wa a great victory for the united state"
"great , ... no more slaughtering of baby from slut mother who dont know how to use protection"
"republican do n't care about life , else they would support universal healthcare . all they care about is controlling and cutting right from woman ."
girl get your wedding dress ready cause if you cant be free to choose neither should he if he get you pregnant he your husband ! ! how many woman would have kept their child if the man married her ? you cant have one without the other .
"in the end this issue will be decided by young woman . remember , the u ha much higher labour mobility than we see in the uk with people far more prepared to move across the country in search of a better life . if access to abortion is a important a people seem to say then young woman ( and especially the more talented one who have more option ) will choose to locate in state with more liberal abortion law . talented young men will follow . it wo n't be long before some corporation start to leave state who restrict abortion because it 's easier to recruit and retain talent in state with a more liberal attitude . alternatively , maybe young woman will prefer to live in place with restrictive abortion law because this will engender a culture with le pressure for them to have sex before they really want to . but whichever way it go , in the end , it will be young woman that decide ."
"exactly the right thing to do , also if you are with a partner/ husband , it should be a joint decision , in other country . woman that take drug whilst pregnant should be charged , the baby should not have to be born a crack cocaine or heroin addict , then they should be sterilised"
men would rather play video game than have sex and deal with feminist so whats the big deal .
america wo n't have many more chance to turn back to god ... woman should think about the consequence before laying down and conceiving these little innocent baby and this so called ten month abortion outside of the womb is murder plain and simple ....
"the header should read `` right to abortion passed back to the state legislator , a opposed to right to abortion struck down , it wa not struck down ."
what else are they going to take away ? ? this is just the beginning ! this is not about saving life this is about exercising power over people and tell them what they can and can not do . god gave u the right to choose good and evil . are we becoming a little china ? were the government tell u what to do a far a reproduction ? are they prepared for all the adoption that are going to happen ? a far a free will and freedom of choice i 'm disappointed in america ! but like the bible say they will start acting like a beast exercising power over people
anything that allows abortion with bidens offspring is a good decision
this artice aim to enforce people 's lack of knowledge of the law and our right . be careful and know your right . wherever you are .
sure wish everyone would hurry up and die already the human race is just pure shlt anymore .
america 's a strange place
everybody forgot god performs ten of million of spontaneous abortion a year .
"lessen the violence of abortion , but increase the violence of gun . pro-file before you 're alive , anti-life once you are . they want to ensure that you are born , and then do n't mind handing someone a gun to shoot you dead once you are ."
oh boo hoo . sick that these woman cry when they cant kill baby
the left - banning legal abortion will only result in illegal abortion ! also the left - banning gun for the law abiding shall stop criminal using gun illegally !
"this issue and the other decision made by our supreme court related to gun make me ashamed of my country of origin . this is a sad day in the u , sadder for our daughter ."
too bad none of these protester could trouble themselves to vote in midterm election . their indifference is the reason this ha happened .
maybe the state should make the penalty for rape a cutting off the offending part too would be helpful
and insulin is still high and l.a. is still in a crimewave .
2:33 - the radiant face of the woke harpy horde . someone meme this .
i guess abortion industry will be booming in mexico
"ah yes , freedom"
insest still ok in royal & elite circle
roe v wade is not a constitutional right .. it wa never intended to be used a birth control .. if law enforcement rule that if a drunk driver accidently kill a pregnant woman and fetus it a double homicide .. but if a pregnant woman intentionally kill her unborn baby it her right to choose .. you ca n't have it both way ! ! there is nowhere in scripture where god give permission for woman to murder their unborn child ... in fact .. he gave a commandment that `` thou shalt not kill `` it did not say only if it an adult
^supreme `` justice '' clarence thomas is a racist ! he will not `` kill '' unborn black baby . peace
"for everyone thats ever had an abortion , remember this . you went against your biological programming to protect your kid , and then you killed it . you murdered your child , nothing can change the fact that you went to a doctor and you paid them to rip your child apart while it wa still inside you ."
this is the future of something is n't done . + the court ca n't just decide thing like this ....
never met anyone on the pro-death brigade condemn their parent for not extinguishing their life in the womb .
they wo n't change gun law which will save life but will revoke abortion right that will ruin life
"21 and terrified lol . not terrified enough of the irresistible trouser snake , evidently ."
america the most backward 1st world country
where is people right to overturning the supreme court ?
"pretty sure even 3rd world country are able to offer this minimal human right . what ha america become now , a 4th world nation ?"
bruh how
"they will force you to carry a pregnancy to term , but do n't give a crap if that same child is shot to death at school . think about that ."
would genuinely hate to live in america for so many reason
"this prof that america is not a free country , banning abortion is removing freedom of choice from woman ."
"85 % of american support abortion being legal in most case . welcome to the death throw of modern conservatism , the last dire swing before the next generation snuff them out with pure disgust at their oppressive nature . dont like abortion ? dont get one . land of the free my as ."
now state can ban it ! scotus do n't want gun regulation but want to regulate woman !
victory for the baby and jesus . thank you jesus for this victory
there is no `` right '' to abortion in the u.s.a. ... i thought this wa the bbc ? ! ?
"look like the fall of civilization . so now we 'll begin to see the rise in back street abortionist parlour , meat shop run by the unskilled and the unhygienic . or worst still , a rise in the birth-rate of the unloved and hated , given a living nightmare that would have otherwise been called a childhood . well done america ."
based . baby killer seething .
how stupid are you to think america care about anyone but the rich .
"this is sad . yet again , another man making decision for a woman 's body . abortion is illegal while gun are not ."
this is awesome .. it 's about time .. no more babykilling
all it did wa return the issue to the state . people can vote for state legislature that line up with their belief and the clinic that you featured ha had woman die . i know this to be true because i work in the emergency room at the local hospital
religion dragging the world back
"the white , evangelical , conservative right ruling the republican party and court will not stop at abortion . next up gay marriage , with some wanting to even ban contraception and sex education in school ."
"`` i 'm 21 and i 'm terrified ! '' well if you keep your leg closed , you wo n't have nothing to worry about will you sweetheart ."
i guess the medium doe n't understand ... all the supreme court did wa give the power back to the individual state .... the federal government should have never had this power under the constitution . now if you feel like it empowers you to murder innocence baby so you want be inconvenience ... that is on you ..... a baby if a gift from god
america is mental now back alley clinic will be all over well done
why did n't someone ask these pro-life woman how many homeless child have they adopted ? how many young mother in need and without job have they helped ?
"this is a minority imposing their personal and religious belief on everyone . this is wrong , and it is clear that the supreme court is no longer a neutral body , but yet another political tool to be wielded by whomever can stuff their side into the most seat ! i honestly blame harry reid . he wa the one that went nuclear and dropped the 60 vote threshold for court pick !"
"easy , or even subsidized access to the morning-after pill may constitute a compromise solution agreeable to both side , a it prevents procreation ."
"abortion is murder . a baby from the moment it 's conceived to birth is a human being . even if you still say that abortion is n't what it clearly is ( killing of unborn child and the extermination of human life ( which by definition is murder ) ) is a denial of the basic fact . `` my body , my choice ! '' is n't even valid because you 're not making the desicion for your body but for the inoccent unborn baby in inside the woman ( the baby is a whole different entity to the mother just the same a you are an indivisual human being ) . you and everyone else that advocate for this foolishness are degrading child from human being to object or inconvenices that can be disposed of . if you say it 's just a clump of cell , that 's not even evidence because you are a clump of cell and every living being is a clump of cell . you would know that if you payed attention in 8th grade biology . that baby will grow up to be a human being just like you and me . what if you 're mom wa to abort you , i bet then that you would n't be advocating for the murder of unborn child ( unless you see yourself a worthless ) . if you state that you can kill an unborn child then it 's the same a saying that you can kill anyone or that i can kill you and by all mean is a violation of human right and basic moral princibles . it doe n't matter about what stage the child is in or what other factor lead to the impregnation you still do not have the right to kill a human being . if you ca n't take care of the child then give it up for adoption instead of outright killing the child . murder : the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another . by definition , abortion = murder . and saying that you could kill a child after it wa born is even more trifling . the child at that point is a living and breathing human being ( even in the womb it 's a living and breathing human being ) . in conclusion , abortion is murder and there is no evidence that you can give that can prove me wrong . not only because it is fact but there are no valid point that can debunk the proven biological fact that a human fetus is a human being . genocide : the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group , the group in question being child . 628.9k child are aborted/murdered every year which is by definition called genocide . abortion is not only murder but genocide . case and point ."
america ha become a nation dominated by bigot and fascist . how embarrassing that they speak english over there .
empathetic prolife supporter versus pro abortion psychopath .
the u supreme court ha just signed the death warrant for 100 of american woman every year . all thanks to trump . man that guy wa in power for just 4 year and he still torment u .
my country doe n't even take care of the child once they are born . all because a few religeous freak want to have more baby to adopt~~~
"can we please put in a law to stop certain people coming to or visiting the uk . it would be those coming from the usa that are pro life and still think it a right to not only carry a hand gun , but also a given right to let 18years old have an automatic weapon , that kill multiple people in one go , including child . we have enough or our own idiot without allowing any more coming in ."
100 million of baby later . after 50 year on concentrating clinic in african american community controlling the population . blm ! justice will come !
"damn , it 's like no one 's ever heard of birth control"
"the supreme court with a majority of right wing dedided to overturn roe v wade mainly impacting all woman in the usa , now all woman in the usa have le privacy and abortion is harder to get ! this again wa decided by the all the conservative which are the majority in the supreme court ! biden need to add 3 liberal to the supreme court now ! to have balance and real debate about issue like roe v wade instead of letting the majority rule just because they want !"
"i have not been enthusiastic with the abortion on demand concept , the `` right , '' for many year since it inception . a birth control method multiplied , abortion did not decrease . abortion wa merely the birth control of ultimate last resort . i think the right to safe abortion wa misused . but now society face the magnified problem of defective and/or unwanted birth . i am absolutely certain that conservative christian men and woman are not going to step up to take in this population of outcast , nurture them and see to it that they are provided for . nor will they require of their political representative that there be incentive for society to the job . it is fanciful and delusional of me to think that female will take the responsible step to protect themselves , and prevent a disembodied soul from emerging a a being who is unwanted ."
"woman will die , million of child will be unwanted because their mother were raped . late abortion is not right but if a woman is raped she ha every right to abort ."
the world 's gone mad .
if u can abort i a a man want not pay child support
usa once again prof itself to be a nation of fool
the best thing that happened in america after a very long time ! ! ! ! ! !
"how many of the anti-abortionists , woman , mother and their teenager daughter , have had abortion , already ! !"
this is absolutely wonderful news . i hope the cult of death weirdo who think only of themselves cry themselves to sleep tonight .
people who want to impose their view in such a controversial subject are intolerant and non democratic people and not other way around . there will be a space for every way of thinking and living in usa a always . but it is important to fight this narrative .
"they just took away my daughter right to choose , and thomas said he is coming after birthcontrol ? i am ashamed to be an american~~~~ love and light world~~~"
"once again showing they 're a completely uncivilised place . they will force a potentially unwanted and unloved child into the world , but wo n't protect them from being killed in a school shooting . the u is the cesspit of the entire planet ."
"the whole system is divided the supreme court , the congress the senate and the church maybe it 's time to change the name of america from united state to divided state lol"
a society that devalues human life is a society that demeans itself ............ democrat are simply evil .
"no such thing a the `` right '' to kill a child , neither outside the womb nor within ."
"never mind , at least you can all carry gun eh"
a reckless court abandoning of past supreme court justice ruling is the downfall of the united state of america court .
"if you do n't want to get pregnant do n't have sex . if you have sex and get pregnant be an adult and take care of your responsibility . seems some woman want a free pas on taking responsibility for their action . you can spot them a mile away they act like child and are abhorrent people , woke feminazi 's and such ."
"western woman and men are too promiscuous , that 's the problem . abstain from sex before marriage or use a condom or morning after pill ."
nobody speaks about the father 's right in that holocaust of baby .
what is going on in america ? pakistan and iran will have more liberal abortion law than large part of that giant lunatic asylum across the atlantic . trump 's appointment of three crackpot religious fundamentalist justice ha caused the court to go off the rail . the decision doe n't even guarantee abortion right for women/underage girl who are victim of rape or incest . individual state will be able to force them to give birth to a rapist 's baby against their will . it 's barbaric and is n't the end . they will push on for the same thing in relation to access to contraception and gay marriage . it 's a if the puritan had just landed .
"if the unborn child could speak : `` my body , my choice ''"
i 'm delighted ! the bbc is hopping mad !
"from the comment i 've read , they are missing the mark massively , the real point is a a woman you no longer have right o we your own body . america ha taken several step back into the dark past . i 'm ashamed and embarrassed for the u . it 's now a backwards 21st century country , well done you republican clown ."
god is smiling today congratulation if we do not protect life nothing else matter stop slaughter baby for god shake
to be honest this decision is just making land of the free false . woman should be able to have an abortion if they feel it necessary
there 's hope for america yet . all life matter .
all this anger . there is a thing called abstinence ! ! birth control ! condom ! just lazy ya let get pregnant and kill the baby . there will still be state that allow abortion ! they act like they ca n't still kill a baby . use birth control . get ur tube tied . there are many alternative . it all about r i. o t. ing . anger n un needed violence . un real
we dont have any of the fact that the doctor based that statement off of god they dont even hear themselves anymore . they cant hear how ignorant and wrong they are .
"it is about money , folk and greed ! ! ! planned parenthood is major money maker and they do n't want to lose their livelyhood ! ! ! ! they do n't care about the woman , and they certainly do n't care about the baby ! ! ! ! !"

fuck this country .
wild that america wa once a superpower . the decline of the country is going to be very interesting for the rest of the world to watch . hope yall learned chinese .
abortion is murder
not even incest or rape will allow you to have an abortion . thats disgusting i pray for america
abortion in the case of rape n incest is ok but abortion should n't be like a piece of cake . it 's not healthy for the mother .
it will still be legal and safe for the woman . now it 's up to the state to decide when to limit it for the child 's sake ... ny say up to and even shortly after birth . tx et al say at heartbeat .
how about british ? is it legal for woman do abortion there ?
every baby should have the right to have a life .
victory to humanity
good news for the mexican tourism industry
such a retarded country . 2022 or 1900s . get a grip america . i wonder how these activist who were against abortion would feel if they had been raped and got pregnant or carrying on with a pregnancy that would have massive health implication . bet they would feel different then . sometimes it necessary .
aleluya let the wicked die .
there are other method of contraception
"i knew the taliban whooped usa 's ass in afghanistan , but i never realised they gained control of american court a well ."
thank you for giving baby their life back . glory to god
"freedom to conform to others concept of freedom , so not freedom then ."
38 million terminated so far ... glad to see it overturned
did u just here the nurse say woman abort just to spite
it 's absurd in this day and age where men can control a woman 's body ! now even rape victim and child from the numerous incest home in the state will have to go through their pregnancy . but fine go and get a ak15 rifle to carry around ! ! !
"you are not a developed country because you make abortion a norm , it 's called moving backwards . how can people call themselves civilized people but find normal to kill baby ? i have never heard a pregnant woman referring to their unborn child a a `` thing . `` so why do stupid creature think abortion is a human right ? and they are able to utter their nonsensical opinion only because no one chose to abort them , foolishness ! how i wish all the pro-abortion creature were aborted !"
a dark day for woman
well if they 've overturned this constitutional right they can overturn the right to bare arm a well
jesus christ is lord ! amen

"state already made their own decision regardless of what these judge say . arkansas i know because i live here ha allowed abortion until 6 month ago then asa hutchison changed it to emergency only . so see how these people lie because apparently abortion where still being preformed in the u . now there showing arkansas like there proudly doing away with abortion a if they hadnt already said they done so lying to their citizen . i dont approve of abortion but who remembers baby tied in garbage bag in garbage can . or backyard doctor doing abortion where woman paid thousand then died because they bled to death . i dont know what the answer is i believe we all must answer to a higher calling somebody , regardless if you believe there a god , there still is a creator of all thing regardless what you call this creator . so should we not all be responsible for our own decision . im not for abortion but i remember the 70 there where so many baby found dead in garbage bag , so many young woman found dead next to coat hanger is this the world the u want . i know i dont , i think it a personal choice the u got it wrong today something too , i think these judge wa part of a bigger agenda here . to help provoke chaos rioting possibly shooting in the u . it what joe and his nazi regime want . what good is being a president if you dont have the final say something is fishy here . it really is .. the majority of people support abortion in this country these judge arent supposed to bring their personal belief into the mix so what prompted the change i think it wa democrat wanting a uprising in the u is who"
statistically a poor decision .
absolutely wonderful .
thank you yankcels . china and russia when ?

"seems like an unnecessary feud to say the least . i wonder how many anti-abortionists care about climate change or the damage big pharma , big tech and the military industrial complex is doing , or poverty or racism etcetc .... not many i 'm guessing ."
my goodness the hand maid tale may be on the way for you american .
let go brandon cant wait for november

"i think there should be more program of safe sex and stricter sexual crime law a it solves the problem of abortion . so i am happy for usa with this decision . congratulation if someone really need abort sure they will find it . it right that is not default a there should be no situation where family would even need to think about it . if there is , the root of the problem must to be found and solved not this genocidical way . unborn kid is not the root of the problem"
nah banning abortion is crazy as hell
stop opening your leg ! ! ! pretty simple
"hallelujah , what a reason to rejoice that people will no longer be allowed to disembowel ; dismember ; decapitate ; suffocate and chemically burn helpless baby . god have mercy on u for allowing this modern day child sacrifice"

"murdering baby for money but painting it a a woman 's right , the left truly are evil people ."
"banning abortion is awful and a disgusting thing to do , but the possibility of banning same sex marriage is simply a red line ! if these bunch of stuck in the past bigoted group of extremist honestly think they can turn the clock back to 1950 without consequence , then they are truly and unequivocally insane . when america turn into a second rate power , let there be no doubt that it wa the extreme far right gop that caused it to fall ."

"abortion in ireland is regulated by the health ( regulation of termination of pregnancy ) act 2018. abortion is permitted in ireland during the first twelve week of pregnancy , and later in case where the pregnant woman 's life or health is at risk , or in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality . abortion service commenced on 1 january 2019 , following it legalisation by the aforementioned act , which became law on 20 december 2018. previously , the 8th constitutional amendment had given the life of the unborn foetus the same value a that of it mother , but the 36th constitutional amendment , approved by referendum in may 2018 , replaced this with a clause permitting the oireachtas ( parliament ) to legislate for the termination of pregnancy . abortion had been prohibited in ireland by the uk offence against the person act 1861. the eighth amendment wa added to the constitution by referendum in 1983 , after concern that law prohibiting abortion could be found to be unconstitutional based on a right to privacy . in 1992 , the supreme court held in the x case that a thirteen-year-old girl who had become pregnant a a result of rape could be permitted to obtain an abortion in the state because there wa a risk to her life from suicide . there were unsuccessful constitutional referendum in 1992 and 2002 that aimed to preclude such ground for abortion in future case . between 1 january 2014 and 31 december 2018 , abortion in ireland wa regulated by the protection of life during pregnancy act 2013 , under which abortion wa illegal unless it occurred a the result of a medical intervention performed to save the life of the woman . in 2012 , irish abortion law received worldwide attention on the death of savita halappanavar , who had been denied an abortion while suffering a septic miscarriage . this increased call to repeal the eighth amendment . the constitutional and legislative provision were discussed at a citizen ' assembly in 201617 , and at an oireachtas committee in 2017 , both of which recommended substantial reform and framed the debate of the referendum in may 2018 ."
regardless of conception once pregnant it is no longer only about you thus i support this .
now they 'll overturn brown v. board of education
"about time , what a medical abomination ."
"0:17 : in case you did n't know : it wa never `` * guaranteed * `` under the constitution in the first place , in fact the constitution doe n't speak for or against . so , it is disingenuous and a misnomer for legacy medium to characterize it so . plus , for the neutral , perhaps it would be fair to put this in context think about this number : 63,000,0000 ! yes , you read that right , over 63m+ abortion ! from 1973-2017 ! before now , only the woman got to decide who life and who doe n't . but now , except in the case of extenuating circumstance like sexual violati @ n , this ruling to return jurisdiction back to the state might perhaps even the playing field and foster accountability ."
well america ha to do something to keep it 's school topped up with victim .
abortion is disgusting and never should have been legal
so if abortion are banned can we have the right to assisted suicide for the one who didnt want to be born ?
the republican taliban ha more to say on woman 's right . birth control is the next one .

"bbc did not read the decision , it seems ."
"there no right for abortion , they were considered a legally killer to humanity life that ha god ( allah ) given to everyone on earth . these shouldnt be allowing at all , life to be borne safely n abortion to be allowed on health status only . killer baby should be punished seriously n there will be no such law to be considered a legally abortion by anyone . may allah blessing , guiding , protecting all of u to live a humanity , justice , harmonious .. etc in life , always .."
the bbc should realize abortion are not guaranteed in the bill of right . abortion are not healthcare it 's mass murder . no female ha died for the right to have abortion
the baby holocaust ha ended
i 'm guessing no one 's actually read the abortion bill .
good . why should a woman decide if my child life and dy ?
this is crazy because two third of american support legal abortion . the majority need to organize and stop being pushed around by a religious extremist minority .
"thank god some good news for once , and spare a thought for all the child murdered under this evil law and let it never be considered acceptable again ."
good now baby have a fighting chance to be born
good decision for the future generation . i know some people arent happy but it what human need . exception circumstance only should allow abortion .

"the main question is that abortion is not a right guaranteed by the u constitution , so it should be left for state to deal with this and other matter ."

how can they ? murder should n't be illegal . we should be able to kill baby all we want obviously .
"america , america , what have you become ?"
the decision wa to allow state to come to their own decision by the people voting in each state . this is the most democratic way to do it rather it being left to a handful of judge . typical bbc misleading biased reporting . there will be plenty of state still doing abortion and plenty of people and group ready to pay your expense to go to these state to have an abortion .
u business . not ours .
"one step forward , two step backward ..."

"the decision just mean state can decide if they want it to be legal or not . and this is essentially better . it let a gay get married in california and a polygamous life their live in their own term in utha . a group of people imposing their idea to oder it is good only if you think like them . abortion is going to continue in many of the 50 estate of the united state . if no central authority can control our life , everybody can live their life in their own term . we are loosing the essential value of democracy and freedom ."
"this comment section ha made me loose my faith in humanity , when people say you should be held accountable for what you say on the internet we all start pulling up 1984 but when this happens you all forget about the handmaid 's tail ?"

"it 's sad but true , abortion will continue regardless many will be unsafe . many woman and child will suffer because of this , woman dying from poorly done `` backroom '' abortion , woman inflicting self harm onto themselves trying to get rid of the child , domestic violence from partner who do n't want the child , more abused/abandoned child from parent who do n't want them etc . both outcome suck , however legal abortion wa the necessary evil to prevent suffering in many circumstance ."
this is great news
people nowadays are so irresponsible . it your body . you know you get pregnant from sex . it your choice to have sex or not . stupid moron . dumb irresponsible worthless people .

"typical american crappy law after all they are happy for everyone to have access to gun that kill thousand of innocent young people and kid in their classroom , but if a woman get raped and is impregnated she had to carry a baby she never want ."
"the u ha taken a step towards protecting the most vulnerable and returning to it founding principle , namely the universal right of all people starting with the right to life . thank god"
the right to kill a child you have all lost your mind when you think a baby life should be terminated . good will be called evil and evil will be called good . these are the last day of a dying civilisation . god help u .
"in 1973 roe v. wade literally made up a fake `` constitutional right '' to abortion which is found nowhere in the constitution . it 's the same thing a happened in 2015 when they made up a fake right to same-sex marriage which is found nowhere in the constitution . justice are supposed to uphold the actual text of the constitution , not make up new legislation and force it on the state . constitutionally , both those question must be left to the individual state to decide via the legislative , not judicial , branch of government !"
baby life matter ! i am happy for this finally !
i like to play a game these day when i watch the medium news - i like to try and spot the narrative - is it for or is it against - forget the good old day when there wa neutrality and they just gave the news . did you manage to spot the narrative - try the game it 's good fun .

i blame religion .... it a woman right .... stop going to a man church
miscarriage will increase dramatically i would guess . this law seems pretty medieval . it 's not good .
notice how all the people celebrating are so f * * * ing ugly they never need to worry about needing an abortion . separation of church and state ? land of the free ? you gave up your right to the vote of 5 people . that 's not democracy .

"suzy boniface and people like her mentioning child killed in school , but how many unborn child have been murdered just because the baby cramp their lifestyle in say the last 50 yr far more than child murdered in school , which is every bit a evil co their all child"
in a short time the court take away woman right and at the same time let gun toting maniac roam the street armed . if it were a movie it would be deemed to far fetched to be credible
disgrace . no court of old fart should tell a woman what she can or can not do with her body . it not an unborn child is a foetus that is growing because a male cell fertilized a female egg . and in the cold light of day the woman may well regret a moment of .......
"seeing some cry over not being able to kill baby anymore is disgusting , that one nurse said getting an abortion saved her life but extinguished the life of another who did n't get a choice to decide like she heartlessly did"
yeah keep breeding moron the world is already at breaking point .... animal
"the woman who claimed that she wa rapped and therefore that case became into law said before she died/passed to the other world that she lied about it ! ! ! because of her and the greedy one million of baby were killed their blood call for justice ! ! ! no more killing of baby , we are not under mullok sacrifice . or are we ? ? ? ? were we ? ? ? and if left to the radical demonds will be ! ! ! no more sacrifice to mullok ! ! !"
"have a feeling it not just about pro-life , pro-choice standpoint . you seen the demographic of wealthy nation ? who going to do wage slavery and keep people supply up for the rich people to exploit else if the poor people get abortion to prevent bad situation both for themselves and their child ? the rich lobbyist dont care if a child grows up in an impoverished environment so long a such can work whatever occupation in future for cheap . think supply and demand , high supply of poorer people and they have to compete for your position and get lower wage , le supply of poorer people and you actually have to pay them and treat them well to get them to work for you ."
i still have no word for this appalling ruling of the supreme court and for it consequence
"in other news , coat hanger sale skyrocket !"
you should n't get to make choice that affect the decision people make in their own best interest # protectwomensrights
misleading title - the decision just mean state can decide if they want it to be legal or not .
"woman have been talking like we live in the 1800s forever . men have no option to opt out of parental responsibility , so to me this is closer to equality ."
get ready for civil war 2.0

"america is based on the god of the bible , the babylonian in the old testament worshiped moloch , they sacrificed child . that 's fast what wa happening to america . jesus christ is the same yesterday today and today , each child is a gift from god ,"
well appreciated for the decision
just remember the same people who like abortion are the same people who want to make saving 18 cent a gallon a federal holiday
"democracy , innit ?"

this is just like prohibition it sound like a good thing but it taking away their freedom of choice people will still find a way around to getting rid of baby by killing them with the taking of drug or secret operation it just sad that american yes again got rid of their own freedom of choice yet again
"a a social worker in georgia in the united state . i see thousand of kid going through the system who never get adopted , no life skill , the majority of my kid emulate what they see and at 18 we kick them out on the street and about 11 % of the kid do get adopted , the rest are just lost , working dead end job , falling prey to addiction and undiagnosed mental health problem and my hand were tied . it wa sad to witness . i really hope they dump lot of money into the system so i can really help these kid"
"the last time the bbc did this , we all took down the video and it wa hilarious ."
they also increased funding to support new mother right ?
obortion is south american sacrifice
"got this mad idea if your not wanting a baby try either proper protection or celibacy , dont blame an unborn child for your own mistake . either that or put the baby up for adoption there plenty of woman who cant have child who would love 1"
america is the most backwards of all the advanced country .
"is not like every human born is going to do anything worthwhile with their life . theyll grow up to be tax smoochers , drug and sex addict , with no ambition of anything in life . no worth in work nor hope in heart ; no wit , nor will to fight . soulless , brain-dead , and over-medicated . # themodernconsumer"
the end of the black genocide .
got ta love hypocrite conservative . it 's only my body my choice if it come to a vaccine . this is n't saving life . woman will get back alley abortion and be forced to birth rape baby . pro life . bullshit .

"i am sure all those who are pro -forced birth , are going to adopt all the unwanted baby"
"ok , folk , no killing of baby until they 're old enough to start school and get gunned down by some coward with a gun ! nice hypocrisy there !"

"good ! ! imagine if all the female took advantage of the numerous form of birth control in which to choose from , how many countless thousand of baby would be saved from murder ( up until birth ) and instead shamelessly playing baby-roullet actually took responsibility . imagine glad i wo n't be forced to pay my tax dollar to this any more"
democrat are going to burn and riot . but life win

"disgusting , and the yank go on about the taliban . woman should own the right to thier own body ."

is this the start of handmaid tale ? !
"so clarence thomas now want more power given to the state . let the state make the law . so now when the republican controlled state all pas law against abortion , state right ! so , when a state now pass a law making abortion legal in that state at 8 month and 3 week , for any reason , , , state right . ? when the suit is brought against it what will the supreme court say , state right ?"
"people should look into the other right we the people have that are n't part of the original constitution , like the right for woman to vote . the way they worded the decision mean they can go after everything that ha been put in place since the original document wa written . religion win again , we will be under religious law soon and you 'll see your right go away . you just wait ."
hobo ch.t . ~ puppy nutta f * wit
"so this hand the power back to the people in each state to decide what they think is acceptable , instead of dc having the power to decide for the country . the democrat are peed off because planned parenting wo n't get million in funding from the tax payer , who then give million to the democrat election time . it 's all a show and medium like bbc enjoy adding fuel to the misleading fire ."
i 'm expecting huge protest that might even turn violent and deadly over the weekend .
a great day for child
`` blue discount sale '' in liberal city across the nation over the weekend . unbelievable price on flat screen and sneaker .
"oh boy . now they can undo mixed race marriage , and woman 's right to vote and birth control .after all they are n't mentioned in the constitution either . i do n't think people understand that thomas said last year that legal precedent is something he doe n't believe in ."

deeply disheartening . our neighbouring country is systematically dismantling hard fought for right . it is going to take so much effort and a renewed compassionate focus to work towards undoing what the current supreme court ha inflicted upon the populace .
what 's a woman
u politician and court keeping the unwashed mass distracted fighting each other on red herring while they make off like bandit .
"woman , if you live in a state where it 's illegal going forward just get on a flight to california and get your abortion . otherwise , bring the baby to term and give it up for adoption and bless someone else with a child if you do n't want to be blessed ."
this is not a historic moment . this is a huge mistake . so many child will now be killed by there parent and trafficker .
the u supreme court decision wa inspired by the great replacement conspiracy theory that white american are losing .

"< i totally agree with what you are saying . i started in crypto in august 2017 , and i bought in . i wa up 5x by december only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch the original investment go down by about 85 % during the ensuing 4 year bear market . i took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 year which wa hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do . i wish i had bought more . i am in profit for now but i am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from jim brin i have learned from you and other youtubrs especially my mentor jim brin who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 11 to 27btc that no one really know what is going to happen in the market .."

"i 'm american . the damn republican did this now to distract from the january 6th committee exposing don the con trump a a criminal . twice impeached trump wa the worst u president in history for many reason . # 1 ) trump committed an act of treason against the u by inciting a violent insurrection on january 6 , 2021 . # 2 ) trump incompetence regarding his management of the u response to the covid-19 pandemic between january 2020 and july of 2020. thousand of u citizen died a a result trump failure . if trump had a proper immediate response to the pandemic the way that the south korean government did , then thousand of u citizen who died would still be alive today . # 3 ) in april of 2019 trump vetoed the resolution to end u military support of saudi arabia 's genocide of thousand of innocent civilian in yemen ! trump wa using the u military to support genocide in yemen ! # 4 ) trump violated the emolument clause of the u constitution for his entire 4 year in office , then in 2019 trump verbally mocked the u constitution . the foundation of the usa is the u constitution , that is why the presidential inaugural oath includes to swear to protect and defend the u constitution . in january 2017 trump publicly swore an oath on a bible at his inauguration ceremony to protect and defend the u constitution . in 2019 trump mocked the u constitution by publicly saying the word `` phony emolument clause '' . # 5 ) trump misogynistically and adulterously said of woman : `` grab them by the pussy. '' ! trump committed adultery with stormy daniel and then tried to cover it up . trump 's former lawyer , michael cohen , wa in prison for crime related to trump 's cover-up of his adulterous scandal with stormy daniel . most republican claim to be the moral party and/or the majority christian party , but hypocritically enthusiastically want to give an adulterous donald trump , another 4 year in office . if a u president who wa a member of the democratic party did the terrible thing trump ha , of course , the republican party leader would be screaming for his removal from office . # 6 ) trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice . # 7 ) trump committed crime of trying to tamper with election , especially in georgia . # 8 ) trump 's attempted abuse of power regarding ukraine . # 9 ) trump committed tax fraud in new york state , which is partly why trump hide his tax return . # 10 ) trump practiced corrupt nepotism a he appointed unqualified member of his family into position of power in the executive branch of government . # 11 ) trump illegally destroyed document and illegally took document with him after he left the office of president . there are many other horrible thing about trump . here are some of them : donald trump is a dumb corrupt businessman which is why he hide his tax return . donald trump is not a self-made man , he benefited from nepotism . his daddy fred trump gave him million of dollar to start business many of which have failed ! donald trump 's failed business are many but include : trump airline , a trump casino , and trump university . with his failed trump university , he defrauded hundred of student . in trump 's many construction project he failed to pay some of his contractor . trump committed fraud with his non-profit in new york state which is why trump recently transferred his residence to florida . donald trump is too stupid to write his own book which why he hired a ghost writer to write `` the art of the deal '' . when trump wa in high school , he hired another boy to take his sat college entrance exam . trump claim that he is smart , but he refuse to show u his college transcript . donald trump 's daddy bribed a physician to write that donald trump had bone spur and therefore could dodge the vietnam war draft . donald trump and his dad also practiced racism in who they would rent property to in the 1960s and 1970s . that is just scratching the surface of the long list of horrible thing about donald trump ."
