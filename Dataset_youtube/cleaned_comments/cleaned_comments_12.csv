so there is a reason to kill a child a friend of mine wa pregnant with a child that had trisomy 18 these child typically pas away within hour after birth my friend wa told she had to have an abortion but she went full term and got to hold her child for several hour before god took his life the parent wouldnt have had it any other way it impossible to know a parent will feel when a child is in these critical situation but we shouldnt be the one to terminate any life from womb to tomb there are also countless time an unborn child is misdiagnosed and is killed out of fear of a defect only to find the child wa perfectly healthy put it god hand pax
abortion is 9497 of the case because the mother doesnt want a baby look at the stats for the outlier case saving a mother life the baby is dead the doctor will make the health care decisionhowever not ready for baby raped too young too immature too careless too promiscuous are not acceptable reason and result in murder of the babyas the baby could be given up for adoption fullstop
attention liberal if youre upset about roe v wade being overturned you should be upset at the democrat party for doing nothing in 1976 jimmy carter wa elected president he had a democrat majority in the house and senate his entire 4 year why didnt they codify roe into law in 1992 bill clinton wa elected president when he took office he had a democrat majority in the house and senate why didnt they codify roe into law in 2008 barrack obama wa elected president not only did he have a democrat majority in the house and senate when he took office one of his campaign promise wa to codify row into law why didnt they codify row into law after making it a campaign promise in 2020 joe biden wa elected president not only did he have a democrat majority in the house and senate when he took office they had a 2month notice that roe wa going to be overturned why didnt they codify roe into law knowing the ruling wa going to be overturned if youre upset the only people you can be upset with is the democrat party for doing absolutely nothing when they had the chance
to say that some woman use abortion a birth control wa utterly shocking and offensive and just go to show the incredible judgement people make about abortion without actually knowing real woman story behind it because i know many woman who have been forced to make that choice and i can not think of a single one where abortion wa being used a a form of birth control i can not think of a single woman who wa so irresponsible and selfish that they did not care about getting pregnant because abortion wa an option thats so ridiculous it would be laughable if it wasnt so offensive and evil to sayand i firmly believe that the energy you put out into the world come back to you and sadly i think thats what happened here i feel horrible for her and im shocked and disgusted that she wa forced to endure that but sadly i dont think the experience ha changed her ignorant thinking on abortion because apparently she is the judge of when it is acceptable yikes karma
stupid people doing stupid thing every vote matter even stupid one too bad democracy in this country seems to work only if it result in a stupid outcome
no she wasnt forced to carry all she had to do wa go to a state that allows abortion no body would have known anything about this except for wanting attention
do republican understand they are voting themselves out of exsistance first they come for the gay next they come for you this is trrorism
they got what they voted for
funny how pro abortionist will cite this a a reason for legalizing abortion but they still want to be able to kill a perfectly healthy child for any reason
biden may be doomed in 2024 by the electoral college can he really win arizona and georgia again and all of those gop candidate are bad the college is inherently unfair to the dnc despite trump ironic claim that he wa robbed he lost because he screwed up the covid response he won in 2016 despite losing the popular voteby two million votesto m clinton and that election may have been stolen by collusion with the russian my solution democrat in deep south state where their vote count for little should move to texas and some of u northerner can retire there and marry african american from almsla and oklahoma i would get a prenup the vast majority of aa are democrat these day if you know someone of a different ethnicity is a democratmarry them instead florida democrat should by the same token get hitched to atlanta dems florida ha been a crucial swing state it too red nowadays gop governor there have refused to let felony exconvicts vote even today they are making them pay restitution to victim after they get out elitist doublejeopardy i sent money to actblue to help pay those fee and it not simply because of the above law either texas is the queen of the electoral chessboard if we steal itwe will have the whitehouse and the house basicallyforever it may eventually turn blue because of latino obtaining citizenship in that state but that would take too long the senate is already blue but just barely so
you knowthe only blessing here albeit in deep disguise is that this show how dangerous the gop isand what happens when dubya trump and the rest put a bunch of ayatollah on our court we on the left bear some of the guilt too by refusing to back the late hubert humphrey because his bos lbj got u into vietnam or voting green party or sitting out the 2000 andor 2016 election because we couldnt stomach moderate democrat i concur that ninth month abortion are by their very naturecontroversial this when the sperm meet the egg crap however need to go among first world democracy we are almost alone in this type of lunacy
absolutely disgusting these hypocritical right wing lawmaker push nonviable fetus to be born why do people vote for these awful people
if you dont want an abortion dont have sex
god forbid you have the baby and love the baby until the baby pass there are place that will help a family through something like this
this is an exception nonetheless it a human baby in utero something pro infanticide advocate never admit to they blatantly ignore biology pick and chose whats beneficial to the horrific agenda also careless adult use abortion a literally birth control which is wrong and irresponsible it the era of taking full accountability for one action
keep your leg shut and you dont have to kill baby
i looked for a really lovely interview ive seen from them and like four other couple who wanted a baby but had issue and texas refuse them abortion and the mother were going to die and the baby were going to die and they still wouldnt do anything and i cant find those interview anymore theyve been scrubbed from the internet they were well done and the couple got to tell their side of the story it wa well done like very classy and everything but now it scrubbed off the internet and this is all i can find is pissing me the f off
when the power you held over men is then given to the state and leaf you powerless karma dealing with what men have dealt with for year abortion right should have never been passed on lie which it wa abortion should have never been used a a contraceptive for lazy people which it wa
my sisterinlaw carried her baby that died one week prior to the due date my brotherinlaw bought her a little baby dress it wa sad but dignified she wa named cristy she wa a baby she wa buried she wasnt thrown away or ripped apart she wa a human just like the rest of u
so the baby is only estimated to make it a year by that logic you should be able to muder any human a long a theyre le than a year old and just call it abortion diminished quality of life doesnt justify killing someone
question i know this may sound insensitive but why arent they going to other state where it still legal i know that in kentucky you can still get a pregnancy terminated if it an ectopic scenario even after the overturning of rvw
a a woman i refuse to deliver 920 baby in my lifetime i have other plan 1 or 2 child and a career in engineering id never live in a state in which politician decide my life and death for me
she deems it necessary in her case how blind can she be
who did you vote for in 2016 election have consequence
the baby should get that year to live rather than straight to heaven right away tho
it suck but at least this child got to pas away in the arm of her family instead of being ripped a part in the womb she will be given a proper burial and be mourned and her family mother especially will eventually heal from this tragedy if they have faith in god plan it doesnt make sense to u now but one day it will this little girl is an angel baby now
top tier karen who religiously take away people basic human right in the voting booth it only unfair because it happened to them massive eye roll
so the citizen of texas can legally go out of state to have an abortion
this will never stop being funny that a trump voter is whining about not being able to get an abortion
new mexico doe not have a cut off of a certain amount of week maybe that particular clinic ha a rule but there are other clinic in the state and i love how she think she ha the right to decide for other mother if an abortion is needed or not no one is using abortion for birth control kylie i can tell they voted for these law so let them suffer whatever consequence come to them and stay tf out of new mexico we have enough people to serve and dont need any antiabortion hypocrite coming here when they suddenly realize that abortion is healthcare they deserve whatever come to them
these antiabortion law are the sort of sht that i would expect from group like the taliban or isi it the christian version of sharia law astounding that these law are being made by people who grew up in a supposedly modern advanced society the gop and religious right are living in the freaking dark age and think they have the right to drag everyone else backwards too
she wa fine with forcing others to abide by her opinion karma may it continue to happen to pro lifer
gop politician if you want to be doctor be doctor if you want to be teacher be teacher but goodness sake you dont have the knowledge of a doctor so you are hurting innocent people you are scaring doctor so they can not give the best care to pregnant woemn i would imagine that we have the fewest medical student going into ob this year you intimidate teachrs so now we do not have enough teacher the funny thing is you are not doing the thing the tax payer want you to do a politiicans like regulation for industryrrailroads and enforcement of regulation you are all talk cruel hateful talk and no real positive action except for futher cheating to gerrymander and take away voting right s and that doe not count i am doing a search of all the story of family have suffered already i have sent a letter to my governor about this issue i guess i need to investigate further who ha authority of making these law that dont have the proper prodicol for woman in an emergency situation they wanted to do something they could have that from the ob doctor in a week so what kind of sick stunt i wonder is there any gop party member who actually care about the well being of his or her consituents i think not the democrat have been very helpful i just dont get it but i guess it ha to do with the trump cult i dont get that at all but clearly trump doe not care about woman and theri heath
not the whole true story but what doe anyone expect from lying left wing marxist devolving abc in the forced socialist dystopia coming full scale in the 21st century
there is no restriction on abortion in nm why is she saying we have a cutoff of 23 week
1 abortion ban do nothing woman will always have the option of abortion whether it banned or not 2 abortion ban actually increase the number of abortion ironically so i guess you people really arent about saving fetal life so much a virtue signaling 3 fetus now have a right that no other human being ha and that is that the government can forcibly allow the fetus to use another person body to stay alive no other human ha ever been granted that right even if you stab someone and theyre bleeding out and you have matching blood type the government can not force you to give them your blood to keep them alive or if you use a mask glove etc but you still accidentally give a disease to someone who is immunocompromised and their organ start shutting down the government can not forcibly make you attach to them and keep them alive with your own organ you used protection so the chance of giving this person the disease that youre a carrier for were very low but it still happened and now theyre dying because of you guess whatthe government doe not have the right to force you to use your body to keep that person alive thats exactly what an abortion ban attempt to do however so im not sure why fetus should have that right when no one else doe
this story is concerning regarding kylie health and the precedent that texas law set here regarding the right to a fetus in baby with alobar holoprosencephaly many are stillborn and if they do survive the birthing process only 50 of patient survive by 45 month of age and 20 of these case survive by 12 month of age 1 they also have major physical deformity including a single eye cyclopia epilepsy and seizure intellectual disability and problem regulating their own body temperature heart rate and breathing which requires them to spend their entire life in a hospital 3 this is a severe economic burden to the family and to the state and could be a major emotional burden to the family involved this is also without taking into consideration the danger that come with childbirth especially when compared to the abortion that kylie wa seeking the pregnancyassociated mortality rate among woman who delivered live neonate wa 88 death per 100000 live birth the mortality rate related to induced abortion wa 06 death per 100000 abortion 2 with that in mind i believe the law in texas endangered kylie life and encroached on her medical autonomy and her ability to make a medical decision that wa in her best interest and safety it could be said that kylie could just go out of state to get an abortion but this place undo financial hardship on a family when there are capable medical facility much closer i understand that people might not agree that the risk to kylie here outweighed the fetus right to life however i think one need to consider the quality of life here i think the law in texas a they stand could cause undo morbidity and mortality to mother in kylie situation and encroach on ethical principle that are generally agreed upon in the medical community
welcome to the consequence of your belief interesting how these people think that abortion is primarily a form of birth control same people that ban the teaching of sexed at school and discourage teenager from having access to contraception that might prevent them from having to be in this situation they are now also looking at banning birth control pill we screamed at the top of our lung for decade why reversing roe v wade wa a bad idea now welcome to your consequence when you think something like this can not happen to you or your daughter in the future
a you can now see the issue of abortion ha never been about saving the baby it been about some weird ultra christianity radical agenda that republican have been pushing on all of u for decade now that the supreme court cracked the door open again republican doing you get to see state not thinking about the law they are passing they are passing extremely oppressive law that never take into account that abortion are a medical procedure which is sometimes very necessary to save the mother or deal with complication that would let a child suffer unnecessarily with crippling defect that are sometimes horrific the crazy thing to me are all the republican woman who still vote to keep these men who are taking away their right in office do they never think such an issue can happen to them or their daughter a side effect of all this are the closing of delivery hospital due to lack of qualified doctor because they are leaving for state that havent gone crazy because why risk your medical license in a crazy state that want to make you a criminal for performing a procedure a procedure that is medically necessary a lot of the time what people forget is that row v wade wa not opened ended it had limitation a to when abortion wa allowed and when it wasnt good luck red state hope you thought carefully about your choice prepare yourselves for 2 thing 1 increase in the death of pregnant woman due to complication 2 dramatic decrease in people getting pregnant because why risk it in a state you cant be guaranteed medical service if you needed them
prolife mean return woman and girl to where they were before 1900 property of men thats the current endgame for these singleissue activist it not a return to the traditional family it not a return to some moral standard that only exists in propaganda this is turning back the clock on woman so their only station in life is pumping out white christian baby
people only care when it happens to them did they think about the woman who were raped and forced to keep the baby but since now it happening to them they say it not fair for woman every decision made ha an impact and sadly thats what it took for them to realize that
the typical people with the land tractor the food making capability and mean of production of industrial work do not believe in abortion if the nonproductive people like to kill themselves and their young i guess what are we to say to that le welfare
i say let them abort it usually the one we dont mind anyway
terminationsabortionsprocedures should be available to woman it 2023 not 1923 cmon wealthy woman have access if they choose but try to convince u that woman should not have access to medical care
antiabortion people think woman wake up everyday hoping well get pregnant just so we can rush to have an abortion it is a painful procedure that no woman want to experience let alone do it over and over a a form of birth control sometimes it is necessary for many reason and nonmedical professional like politician shouldnt have a say in it they are not qualified to say if it should happen
a life is a life
prayer for this family
ban abortion imprison anybody that want it legal demon will respond negatively when you speak up for innocent baby
theyd rather a woman die from a dead fetus rotting away inside her because theyre not prolife theyre pro forced birth
wait a minute who ha to pay the bill which can be ten of thousand of dollar once the baby is due this is so unfair im asking a a concerned neighbor from canada
there are always consequence to choice that involve forcing personal belief on others enjoy
unless it affect the mother right a if the mother mental health mean nothing try carrying a dead baby to term and not lose your sanity jesus fucking christ
it wrong that woman parent and child suffer because of a ban once a child is born no one will be there for it there not enough resource and money to make sure every child is taken care of properly then you get case of child neglect abuse or death because other people choose that it wa wrong and a waste of life those same people arent there to raise the child born with health issuesproblems arent there to protect a child from an abusive parentguardianfoster parentadoptive parent they arent there when a child ha to live like this poor baby or be there when a baby is carried full term only to diesuffer secondsminuteshours later due to a foreseeable illness that couldve been prevented if given an abortion later on unless it happens to you you dont think about other people life till then it doe effect everyone in the end more negative than positive
no joe or jane average should have any say in another person medical choice period funny how conservative think they get to control everything including other people choice
who care thats what they voted for
nobody should be forced to endure this horror sick mentally sick emotionally sick before god in heaven sick before u constitutional law cruel and inhumane grotesque it is sick that a minority in the u is being allowed to force their sick unbiblical religious belief onto the majority of u citizen it unconstitutional prepare to witness this and other horror over and over and over again just like we did in the 20 30 40 50 and 60 woman will die unnecessarily because of these situation and their baby will die along with them
i tell everyone whose pro life in their politics this is why im pro choice politicallybanning abortion lead to health complication and poorer health service for woman through studying country with complete abortion ban we can see it lead to nothing good for woman
this is so sad and not right i cant believe this is happening in america
butbutfreedumb what a joke
good it should never be ok to slaughter unborn baby for your own selfish benefit
no one is forcing her go to a midwife and get misoprostol put it in your vag and it will release the baby
the only moral abortion is my abortion this is what you voted for
birth control is to prevent pregnancy if youre pregnant is not birth control abortion is not birth control
it is so hard to see these people struggle with the loss of their baby and now on top of that this woman must wait to become sick before she can get help the abortion law are getting out of hand the government is sentencing woman to the brink of death before allowing medical professional to intervene and putting healthcare provider between a rock and a hard place however what is the government doing to provide woman of childbearing age with the resource to prevent getting pregnant in the first place the answer is nothing obtaining birth control can cost hundred of dollar a year something some people cant afford sexual education class are being criticized and removed from school not allowing the public to gain information and make informed decision now in south carolina a bill is being considered that a woman can be eligible for the death penalty if she receives an abortion i struggle to see how this is beneficial for anybody these law infringe on patient autonomy making it difficult for medical provider to care for these woman because they will also be punished this is one time that law and medicine should not be mixed because it ha poor patient outcome who is responsible for the patient medical provider are not the government more dangerous thing are happening in the country like gun control and school shooting that are on the rise that need to be addressed first not a woman health that should be between her and her doctor only
it important to remember that abortion is healthcare and there are many reason why somebody may need or want to have an abortion regardless of the reason pregnancy even the most uncomplicated one can cause adverse health effect and no one should be forced to make a healthcare decision they dont want to i also want to address that the vast majority of people receiving abortion are not using it a birth control the bronx abortion clinic reported that about fifty percent of the woman who receive abortion used some time of birth control in addition more than fifty percent of the woman receiving abortion had never had one before while i want to emphasize that not all abortion are because of unplanned pregnancy this should not limit abortion to only those case some people who have unplanned pregnancy may want to continue with it but if they do not it is unethical to make someone continue a pregnancy this will violate many people autonomy if they have no choice in what change occur to their body
republican always always vote _against_ themselves then blame the left for everything bad in their life
what about if the pregnancy is ectopic thats a situation where the baby absolutely can not survive and the mother could bleed to death
this is what voting for greg abbot get u
the fact that she said i dont believe in it a a form a birth control just go to show the lie conservative are told
texas mother banned from saying welp kid gon na die anyway so we might a well torture and butcher im to death for grin and giggle ftfy there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to torture child to death if your threeyearold were dying of cancer would you proceed to dismember and disembowel them or would you put them on pain med and hold their hand until the end like a normal human being who is actually capable of love why should it be any different for any child younger than that
thats really sad
lol you got what you asked for
she say that she doesnt see it a a way of birth control but if she doe it while pregnant shes literally controlling a birth by stopjng it from happening
karma is a bitch
abortion is murder
it a baby no matter what carry that baby and nurture it best you can a long a you are healthy and god will take care of the rest just because it doesnt have a brain doesnt mean you can decide to abort it
i believe it wa said before that it easy to have belief but it difficult when those belief conflict with your or your family rightsfreedoms
welcome to the consequence of voting for an abortion ban you are at the receiving end of what you voted for stop complaining this woman lack compassion for other woman who need or want an abortion is the root of her problem
this is the america yall want so whats the problem
huh maybe we should be prochoice
this sickens me soo much dont people get it these law hurt woman
be careful what you wish for vote for hypocrite it good for me but not for thee welcome to your own nightmare
thank u abc for bringing to u extreme case and play with emotion how about you bring the many woman who have abortion after a one night stand and couldnt be bothered
everything that ha breathe praise the lord
glory to god for life
thank god im australian were so sorry
people need to see that sometimes abortion are necessary
when she call it a procedure what she mean is an abortion is healthcare
no men or woman in cult should be allowed to determine the health for all other woman
it disgusting the greed and selfishness of other people i dont even have to watch it to know this is evil anyone against abortion are evil and here is why medically they are needed for thing like this not every pregnancy is healthy and can survive say a mother ha 5 kid already and now a 6th on the way and the baby pass she get septic she dy thats 5 other child without a mother because her choice wa taken from her no it not the case for every pregnancy but thats where it up to the individual you are a po if your getting abortion because your irresponsible not because a rape an accident from failed prcations im taking about your 24 in because you cant be responsible which at that point you shouldnt be having sex but thats not always the case there are case where a child being born can subject them to more suffering then living there documented case look them up im not here to make you grow a a person and change your mind im here to explain that your very close minded and ignorant to have to go through these thing in order to understand they are real after some easy googling can educate and save life and or prevent them for the better it evil to subject people to this
im so sick and tired of people saying abortion isnt birth control no one anywhere is having unprotected sex under the thought of oh ill just pop into the abortion clinic next monday also im lowkey loving that people like her are part of the take responsibility for your action crowd guess what sweetie youre learning about the consequence of your action you voted for these law you got em
she voted prolife and thats what she got she only had compassion for herself and not other woman that desperately needed abortion across the country no sympathy for her
never in a million year would we expect yeah exactly you didnt think this could happen to you the rest of u know it can happen to anyone
i know people who have suffered due to her voting i hope she know the consequence of her action to the fullest
hurt my heart that voter cant imagine instance like these where abortion is necessary until it affect them personally how ignorant i do feel very sad for their family though
that is so tragic im so sorry for your heart break
this is absolute insanity
this is what i try to get people to understand about abortion but people wan na stand on their view because they know better but they wont get it til they go through it
these people are literally sad because they can not kill their child if you stop to think about it thats what this actually is it a tragedy that the baby ha abnormality but ultimately they want to destroy the baby because they are scared of having to deal with a child with abnormality who the doctor said wont live long their solution kill it what ha society become
living in texas is living in a fascist state our republican government is ruining what once wa a great state
everything happens for a reason i hear so many story of thing like this happening to upper middle class white texas family they change their tune on abortion pretty quick i have little sympathy for them because they made their own bed my husband and i talked extensively about issue that could arise with pregnancy and birth before we even tried to get pregnant
please contact me i will gladly adopt your child i live in illinois my oldest son wa diagnosed with alobar holoprosephencephaly when i wa 3 month pregnant the doctor insisted i abort and they continuously said to be prepared for when he took his first breath of real air he would die let me tell you he is now 12yrs old every obstacle and deadline they gave him he surpassed with flying color each and every time if you dont want your baby because of the chance and challenge that will come with every child give him to someone who will love them unconditionally a a mom of 3 2 of which are special need in two very different way just give them a chance at life because you never know what they can accomplish with love and support around them
and these dumb politician think they know it all unbelievable plus people uninformed
terminating an abortion because the baby will potentially be disabled
so much for freedom in your country disgusting and barbaric
totally misleading title watch the whole video the pregnancy is still viable and the baby is not dead in the womb
they look like they can afford a plane ticket to another state or drive so get over it take precaution not to get knocked up in texas next time dont like it you are free to move out
that poor unborn fetus ha my sympathy they should never be put through any of this those parent however i have no more pity for people who cant see something a a problem until it stop at their front door maybe they should have thought about this before they went in to vote away their right a parent
im so sorryprayers be with you
it easy to say im anti abortion in all instance and tell everyone else that they are evil until you hear these story very few topic are black or white good or evil and people need to know that there is nuance to thing let expand access to birth control and stop woman using abortion a such
i understand political pro life agenda what is behind it and why they push it but every day person especially woman who vote for this seem truly stunted in their critical thinking any woman voting for this not getting that they can end up in situation they dont want that can kill them that can harm their child not just the one your pregnant with if you already have child they will be scarred too men who vote for this not realizing that woman in their family their wife can end up here how rotten you must be to want your partner and your child to suffer when you can avoid it deluded evil people
this is b a in not true people really need to do research there is a very clear difference between a nonviable fetus and a healthy fetus that is likely to come to term it is possible she may have to carry to term for health reason a the pregnancy may be to far along and this is the safest option so thank abc for being full of it
but i didnt know leopard would eat my face say woman who voted for the leopard eating people face party
im embarrassed to live in texas and cant wait to get out everything sux for everyone everywhere in america well except for like 7 family and i accidentally watched this otherwise i dont trust any news outlet
i thought almost all state dont allow abortion that far along it hard to pretend it just a bunch of cell my baby started kicking not too far beyond that
i pray for them and their baby and that they give him the most love they possibly can during the life span he ha
shouldve not had that sex if you were not ready for the consequence
yes right it wa all cozy in the sheet so take responsibility
there it is in a nutshell how quickly the conservative republican want to back track once they feel the heat of their own decision brain dead monkey
if the child doe die youngat least you did right by him by loving him and fighting for him
doctor say abort 1 of 3 because pregnancy is dangerousmom said no mom ha 3 healthy happy baby
last man in iron lung doctor said he wa dead to tb another doctor take him put a tube in and place him in the iron lung he lived he became a lawyer and wrote a book he is alive today you love your child but to an extent thats not unconditional you never give up especially with your child
thats your son and you dont want to give him a chance thats sad you wouldnt fight because doctor have been wrong a lot
people have no idea how many time a doctor ha said there is no hope and the person thrived you abort that child you give them zero chance
thats crazy
i know the catholic position is human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception and in summary from the first moment of his existence a human being must be recognized a having the right of a person catholic and protestant often cite passage from exodus 20 for why they believe human life begin earlier than birth even if you accept their argument it pretty stupid to force woman to carry nonviable pregnancy these by definition can not form human life i just dont see the point often time i can see some self consitancy with people i disagree with for example many war monger just want more land and a larger taxbase this might not be great for everyone involved but i understand their position the law is just stupid even if you believe a fetus is a person the best non viable preganncies can do outside the womb is maybe have some cell live on a a collection of cell culture to be used for research purpose although the scientific value of these might be dubious since a tissue culture of kidney fibroblast hepatocyte or myocyte from a nonviable pregnancy might be different than a sample from a baby
this video title is fallacious the pregnancy wa viable by definition
honestly i dont really feel bad for her i do feel bad for woman that didnt want or choose to have their right stripped from them this woman is part of the problem and only figured it out when her pregnancy wasnt viable i told my husband that the only way these republican were going to figure it out wa when it happens to them guess what
unfortunate but you get what you vote for
we cheer with every freedom taken away the insanity of our new republican religious police state america
for people who are against abortion that is your right you can be against it that doe not mean you can force others to have the same stance that is their right you can believe it is imoral and murder but you have no right to another person body for those that are against it for religious belief thats fine but not everyone ha the same religious belief i could be wrong here a i have not been church since i have been old enough to make my own choice that i do not follow those belief but it is god job to deal with those that sin not yours so you csn belief these people are doing wrong and sinning but it still not your place to do anything about it instead trust in your god and let them handle it
i believe a woman should be able to do what she want to do with her body i just had to do an abortion and it something i have always said i would never do especially since i always thought i couldnt have child circumstance change i have 3 child my youngest just turned 5 month me and my family live in a 2 bedroom apartment and only my husband is working now we possibly cant keep the baby a much a it tear my husband and is heart it something we know is the best for our family and we will try again once we are where we need to be i feel for any woman now a day who cant get what they need to get done in order to live healthy happy life
and when woman start dying from sepsis because they have a dead fetus rotting inside of them and they cant have it removed because the law view it a abortion yall conservative are gon na beg for abortion to be legalized again
thats cruel
girl bye karma got you for your hypocrisy for those who dont know the full story this woman suffers from pcos it come with complication of conceiving alone in the 1st place and other factor regardless your political affiliation religion abortion is necessary it is a life saving medical procedure now imagine for a moment all surgery are ban sound ridiculous right because it is i swear people are beyond stupid today
you reap what you sow
do we euthanize terminal cancer patient simply because their condition is incompatible with life it is barbaric to kill a child because of a birth defect his life belongs to god there should be hospice care and palliative care team helping parent in these situation prepare for the loss they will grieve for their child regardless let it be in the midst of lifeaffirming moment instead of death inducing procedure
everyone want to focus on rape and incest it happened to me i had to terminate a pregnancy that wasnt going to make it to the end and everyone ignored me
sorry but i agree with her ive known so many woman that use abortion a birth control situation like this the abortion is warranted a well a situation where the mom life is at risk period some of yall are murderer
good for her she went through with exactly what she believed in hope people like her go through with it a thousand time they are the one that put other woman through all the pain and suffering
the title of this video is inaccurate and deceptive the pregnancy is not nonviable carrying nonviable pregnancy to term is an oxymoron the doctor said that the infant usually do not live to the age of 1 she didnt say they usually die in utero this is a baby with a disability that sadly ha a short life expectancy calling the pregnancy nonviable is untrue this baby deserves a shot at life like every other baby
sooooo did she get rid of it whats the outcome were left with a cliffhanger
i think everyone need to cut her some slack
can you believe they have a daughter and voted for this insanity now they are scared for her noe they hate the law they helped pas someone please explain this level of cognitive dissonance my brain just doesnt grasp this kind of hypocrisy and ignorance
see up until 252 i felt bad for you now i feel like you got what you deserved abortion arent only for birth control and even if they were it not up to you to decide what happens to other woman body enjoy this taste of your own medicine
develop all this technology to save yourself and then just go back i mean were not evolving were regressing
so she want to abort a nearly full term baby because he will be handicap and die young but she doesnt think other woman with different circumstance shouldnt be allowed
i want to feel bad for her but i dont she voted for this with no regard for any other woman she didnt care until it started affecting her abortion ban are awful for everyone not just some woman
if you vote for other woman to not be able to have an abortion for whatever reason they want to how can you be mad when you are denied the right to
you can always go to another state if you feel the need to terminate
stop saying procedure it an abortion
she still deems what is considered ok to get an abortion thats the problem people deeming what other people should do husband seemed more empathetic with woman than her she should make change in her belief
i do not feel bad for her at all she voted for this now feel the consequence
so heartbreaking for this family im tragedy like this we should have the right to choose god bless
interesting how people think that aborting a healthy and viable baby is comparable to aborting a nonviable pregnancy and therefore this woman is a hypocrite what it totally not the same thing
ancephaly is always used by abortion advocate it is extremely rare if mom is perfecty healthy she should carry baby to birth baby is alive in there let baby live life god ha willed it tragic for parent but we all know pregnancy is a risk
they said with the baby condition it ha le then a year to live hopefully thats true because the child wa not meant to be born the pro sadist movement only wanted the child born so he can suffer i hope something go wrong and the child is not born honestly if a woman is not going to have an abortion i hope they miscarry
good karma it what she deserves who care
some parent go that extra mile and step up to try to give their baby the best life it can have while it can have it and others choose to throw it away bc they arent perfect how tragic and dont even flippin say i have no idea what theyre going through bc i do but i chose to give my baby life despite her severe birth defect
shes anti abortion just getting a taste of her own medicine
this is a hold regardless it wa conceived out of love id want to be able to at least hold my child this is truly heartbreaking
they still voted for trump and abbott
there are certain instance where i deem that it is necessarybut youre pro life and all life is sacred right oh but you see it a necessary because it will affect you got it so all life is sacred until it negatively affect you guy cool hypocrite this is what they voted for and now theyre looking for sympathy gtfo i hope they remember that jesus is watching lol
that is a flat out lie to expect doctor would intervene in this case is ridiculous
the husband couldnt imagine hmmm
maybe let vote for political figure who care instead of those who make law who hurt people
republican are monster why force this trauma on people people can make decision for themselves my heart hurt for them
vote to change law keep speaking about it to others for more change
why not go somewhere else to get help though shes not a prisoner of texas
literally no one us it a birth control you are pro choice sweetie if people using it a birth control is your worry then vote for free 99 effective birth control instead of free condom at a health department that are hardly used properly yall voting for the wrong thing abortion is a medical procedure that ha been stripped away from doctor and interpreted into political opinion
personal choice it cant be ok for you but not for others
this is so difficult to go through and sad that your baby ha not developed normally you need to be aware that this beautiful baby is still a baby and not to be discarded terminated or aborted this baby is precious and all life should be loved and nurtured the baby might not have a long life but you need to give the baby a much love a possible in this short period loving holding your babykissing and talking with it whether one ha a baby with a heart defect abnormal body missing limb or any other disability the baby deserves to be loved and nurtured and a chance of life
be careful what you vote for people you have to read it all the politician are sneaky and well are not always honest and forthright so heartbreaking
it may be a moot point a more and more obgyns ditch the profession or move out of state like texas sadly woman and child in rural area will bear the brunt of that
i told my other half he need to go get his colonoscopy 3 state away his response what for i live here i should be able to get the care i need it between me and my doctor same thing with abortion people stop sticking your nose into people medical procedure im pro minding your own business thanks
that is barbaric and inhumane that woman must have been so depressed
non medical people making medical decision just like many health insurance company judge and politician who going to help folk pay for the health care in case like these how much money is in the state or federal budget for pre post natal care
isnt this what woman like her voted for
shed those tear mommy
doe anyone in the comment know these two people personally no none of you know a fuckin thing about what these people are having to go thru this woman life will be in danger until after she delivers then they saddled with the amount of care this child will need until it pass if it life after a couple month theyre looking at million of dollar in medical debt for a terminally sick child all because she couldnt get the care she needed at the time she needed it not one of you mouthy overly opinionated undereducated freak would be able to do any better i pray everyday that our country doesnt fall into the hand of the oh so enlightened woke people bc the second it doe were all fucked id like to see a tax or some kind of something that would be enough to regulate bullshit and promote truth and fact sits back to watch the shitshow this is about to be lmfao
but why do something that later affect you like stay abstinent or sterilize yourself if you dont want a poor innocent child
i understand where she is coming from but i do know of some woman who have gotten 4 or 5 abortion just because they didnt feel like having child everyone should have the choice to choose what they can do to their body but some people abuse it
i hate when they call it a rare condition because there are thousand of these rare condition and cumulatively they are not that rare almost a year ago on the 21 week ultrasound my wife and i found out that that the baby had a severe skeletal dysplasia with small rib and undeveloped lung and would suffocate to death after birth weve met many other people with very similar story from other rare condition it can happen to anyone trying to have child
u presidential candidate we are all human here we know that if there is complication with birthing then the law doesnt apply to that one civilian the law is to put order in chaos doctor mediate with congress god watching here in the u we live by the ten commandment we do not kill here in the u i received karma in my dream for abortion god ha spoken with scientific truth but salvation of life is law a well saving life is the positive karmic debt
who to say that this child wont come out normal and live a normal life
so this girl ashley and i had been friend since freshman year during summer we began spending more time together we hooked up just one time thats all it take i have to note that at that time i wa in and out of jail on probation fighting case and before i turned 18 id go away for 2 year in prison i wa reckless and knew i wouldnt make a good bf we both had grown some feeling for each other hers more than mine but once she found out she wa pregnant and told me i honestly began really thinking about changing my life my feeling grew for her and i wa willing to grow up and be a dad and bf she allowed other people to get in her head and behind my back she went and got an abortion i found out from someone else a couple week after i wa crushed even though i lived a rough life and could be violent towards men at that time i wa always real gentle with kid and wanted one that baby literally couldve saved my life because i would end up doing a total of 6 12 year locked up not caring about anything or anyone later on at 28 i would get engaged to a single mom we didnt work out but i still talk to the kid im 35 and still no kid single etc havent been in trouble since 2014 and live a normal life sorta havent dated since though most people have kid at my age and getting close to kid and breaking up is probably the worst thing ive been through and thats saying a lot idk i hate abortion because you deprive the world and others of a life that could possibly change thing for the better sorry for the long story ive never talked about this before thank you for asking this felt kinda therapeutic to think and write about it side note the abortion had a negative effect on ashley she started partying doing drug and became promiscuous we ran into each other when i wa fresh out at 22 she wa a stripper then and her life wa chaos she later got pregnant and had her son which totally calmed her down and now she seems to be a good mom i think he 78 just wanted to point out that abortion hurt both of u
good time to hold you lady to higher standard condom and birth control exist for a reason let not act like you lady arent abusing abortion for a birth control maybe we need to start making better decision and choice
so the state are already overwhelmed with too many child they cant care for and thats all that this is going to do is add to that problem so the people who so badly want this to be legal will be the one who end up so badly having to figure out what to do about the mess that they made and the child will suffer for it
they try to control woman and their body but men who love family suffer too it seems just jerk are happy in this scenario for forcing others to live with their stupidness and bias we came back to hundred year ago technology doesnt bring u forward our mentality and respect to other human right bring u forward saudi arabia ha technology but they live in the past our society started to backward
texas got what it want full control over woman taliban texas
i am sorry did you say non viable uh wow sorry dear we lost a well
im so sorry woman have to deal with this no government or judge should have the right to play doctor unless they have a degree a a doctor
these people definitely sound like republican you get what you vote for
i understand the want to terminate in this case in texas when something like this happens you go out of state im a christian and i vote for republican all the way abortion is a fine line however i think it more of a moral issue i think we should have the choice i believe we should have the personal choice that we then have to live with for the rest of our life and in my christian belief we then will be judged by our maker for that choice it should still be a choice it freedom and the lord gave u freedom every choice however ha a consequence the problem is the woman that use abortion a birth control happens far too often this is murder
why are they even on tv they made a stupid vote they can enjoy it
ew shut up hypocrite live with your vote
when did the government have rule over an individual body it like the twilight zone or another dimension existing in various dimension human are just the energy particle experiencing and observing all at once
gone back to the middle age
you reap what you sow lady so you should have the option because of your specific circumstance but other woman and their circumstance dont count hypocrite
im so glad i live in a country where i get to choose
this is why it should be a woman choice it is our body
you never know what god can do maybe that baby will be healedto make a decision to end his life is foolish no one ha even laid their eye on him in person he is still growing and everything peoplewhat are you thinking
criticizing and therefore ostracizing this woman isnt the way to build bridge or make progress none of u are perfect and we have different life experience and point of view support would be a much more productive approach
thank god i wa born and raised in north carolina and there is no rule against getting a abortion thank you north carolina tbh more woman should move here to have there baby if something go wrong like this tragedy nobody can stop you from terminating the pregnancy
to me it an example of one extreme to another abortion whenever use it a birth control it a right to sorry carry that dead baby to term oh youll die if you remain pregnant too bad ive yet see anyone argue abortion is wrong unless the mother could due ectopic pregnancy for example shes raped surely there a way to know if shes lying and this though i know after a certain point theyd induce labor this thoughoh sorry watch the baby die after birth though the whole have compassion argument people are using is just a bandaid to me ok have compassion for the life growing inside you rather than think kill it cue the responsibility argument another bandaid nothing will change because of this one extreme to another mindset
conservative if you got pregnant now you will bear the consequence for your action you should have closed your leg since you are so obsessed with the consequence of your action you are now suffering the consequence of your action voting for an antiabortion law hypocrite
look what youve done america we are in 2023 you have created a world for woman that you have gone to war over what a woman doe with her body is between her and her doctor you have become your enemy in more way than one
sorry not sorry live with your action maybe your dead baby will end up killing you one le idiot in this world
god bless you both and protect you and your family it is an unimaginable tragedy to think that your own republican congressman are taking this decision out of the hand of you and your physician is an abomination i pray for your health and safetyand that your repub congressman somehow are enlightened to the scientific fact of your case and so many others god main lesson ha always been to love one another he also said judge not lest you be judged i am so fed up with these bible beating repubs trying to use the bible against the others a they see them they have clearly not read the entire bible
i have never met a woman who us abortion a a form of birth control many of them used condom that either failed or were intentionally tampered with or realized their birth control wasnt working a a result of illness or antibiotic and they werent excited for an abortion either smh i cant with these people
not enough gas to drive to the next state over gim me a break
im still prolife this story doe not change my mind
250 abortion isnt used a birth control quit saying that birth control doesnt cost thousand of dollar people who say im against it being used a birth control are brainwashed
this couple is delusional they dont even know what theybare saying also they said the procedure cost 10 to 15 thiusand dollar in colorado and it wa out of the question but they want to have more kid even when they dont have 10k in the bank poor mentality
i voted for the leopard eating people face party but i never thought leopard would eat my face
hmmm something tell me this story isnt telling u the truth also abortion are murder heart beat mean life
it wasnt a medical emergency she wasnt dying woman lose baby at birth all the time no one want to talk about that if she didnt know guess what she wouldve gave birth instead of ripping the baby out in piecesshe should be happy she got to see her baby outside the womb and show love for the last time and bury him properly
wheres your coverage on this story live action
this is so absurd why people are electing these horrible politician
your american taliban
look like the shoe on the other foot
im against using abortion a a form of birth control so if some girl wa raped and impregnated through rape you believe she must be forced to carry out her pregnancy the reason shouldnt matter let a woman decide period
im not for abortion in case where people were irresponsible but this is an obvious case come on common sense
hmm not sad for her at all now i am supposed to care about what they want you helped to take away our choicevoting ha consequence
let me get this straight she isnt carrying a dead baby but a baby that will eventually die at the age of one
shes concerned now because it effecting her
so the problem here is that two parent view the difficulty of an otherwise normal pregnancy a a burden because the baby might live long enough to be an inconvenience am i missing something or is that the big story here the big story is that people who identify a pro life became pro choice because of personal inconvenience there no concern for their child this illustrates why abortion need to be criminalized in texas for everyone who participates in an abortionnot just the abortionist human life ha been reduced to viability based on convenience we are in a bad way we need to become abolitionist not pro life it a term that ha lost it meaning
horrible law by america
they should put abortion on the ballot in every state
is it illegal to go to another state and get an abortion genuinely curious not trying to invite people to do it but id rather travel to a country where it legal like mexico it legal safe and cheap
the high cost of living
you could come to new york state and gotten an abortion he will do abortion if there something wrong with the baby up until the day ofyou could come to new york state and gotten an abortion he will do abortion if there something wrong with the baby up until the day of the baby first anybody watching desk that read this comment and you need help because your state will not allow you to have an abortion new york state will provide it for you free of charge they will give you a new york state medicaid so that you can get your procedure done there are place that the clinic know that get donation to pay for your plane ticket they will pay for your hotel dental place that ketchel nation that pay for everything associated with your travel to new york state the procedure itself aftercare and the way home do not go through something like this because you feel you have no other option new york state will 100 do the procedure for you and there are place that will help pay for your travel if you cant new york state allows abortion up to the day of birth even if your past your due date and they find that something is wrong with your baby and your baby is unable to survive and ha a terminal condition even if youre in labor they will perform the procedure for you there wa a big thing on it it ha not been decided by the supreme court it still allowed to happen do not feel like you have no place to go new york state will help you i wish i knew of this video or knew of her need i would have told her and helped
so real guy men and woman too who voted for this live n fantasy world make me sick im so sorry for her
this is political propaganda so her child is ill thats not a justification for slaughtering thousand of child out of total convenience and selfishness abortion wa murder before her child started developing properly and it will be murder afterwards interview a person who survived abortion and wa healthy and is now disabled because mom didnt want to be a mom
you can order the abortion pill online from aid access
some woman thinking it never happen to me until it came and than anger cry that what happen when this woman dont involved fight for their right one apple is rotten in a basket soon the rest of the apple will also rotten to fungus
i bet this family wish they didnt live in the state of texas wonder if they thinking about moving out of it like other family and people are doing getting the hell up out of there relocating to another state
honestly i dont wish these thing on anyone im staunchly pro choice i dont care why you choose an abortion i hate that it took this for someone to understand why these ban are devastating to more than just the type of woman you think need to learn the consequence of sex but im heartbroken for them anyway im a mom i have two boy i love them so much could i imagine ever choosing an abortion no do i see every day how it may be the only right option to alleviate suffering for mom and or baby yes i do rather we think it wrong or right i believe thats between the individual and god and it above my pay grade abortion is healthcare and woman deserve access to it
god punishes the ignorant and this family is lucky that that doctor saved them from their own hypocrisy selfish brainwashed moron
forced to you would have had to if you lived off the land like human used to you would have had to done this anyways and why not is it so horrible to see your own child at least one time before burying them hold them kiss them you know be a human not just discard it like a bad tuna sandwich stop playing victim this is the natural order of life
is the baby growing doe it have a heart beat or is she carrying a lifeless baby she ha to keep the baby inside her cant she get sick or something go wrong
lawmaker can not be this stupid make 1 law that allows to remove a dead baby that miscarrieddied naturally a 2nd law that prevents killing a live baby stupid stupid stupid
it is legal is other state always choose life these rare case dont justify million of lost healthy baby abortion is not birth control btw not the same thing at all
good for the baby it will have a name there will be challenge but the lord will show the parent a strength they arent even aware they have to help their son or daughter praise the lord for the life he give u freely
miscarriage is not the same a murdering an unborn baby 1 baby dy naturally the other is alive murdered damn people are stupid
this is what happens when our basic human right are violated by very stupid men and a corrupt supreme court full of mysoginists shameful and beyond idiotic
i voted for the leopard eating my face party and now leopard are eating my face and i dont like it
they not going to let you carry a dead baby just stop the propaganda
sound like a b story
you get what you vote for now that it is in your lap instead of in the lap of yet another nameless faceless family that you never have to meet speak to or understand now it a problem i feel so bad for the baby who will suffer without any good reason because of these law and the belief of people like you that directly contribute
bless her soul so tough
this is absolutely fucking devastating
never in a million year did i think id be the one going through this yup exactly the issue this is how we end up with b law not grounded in reality
i hate texas
your baby ha a medical issue and you want to abort at 6 month pregnant wtf if wrong with people
lol it what yall voted for
carry it to term then let the baby die naturallyno med nothing
she got what she voted for if 15000 for the colorado abortion wa too much wait until they get the bill for the inevitable csection and nicu no sympathy whatsoever for this hateful the only moral abortion is mine modernday version of eris
thank you joe biden for taking our right away
abortion are health care for woman
i went thru the same thing sorry to say my situation wa in 1981
that is soo sad
they need to go back and change these law it our body and no one should have the right to tell u what we can and cant do with them i feel so bad for her and can you imagine the mental health issue she will have after this and lasting so long like how stupid is this law it make me so angry
and she still cant empathize lol oh christian
abortion is our right ha female
forcing a woman to carry and birth a baby that wont have a good quality of life or that will suffer is just wrong i dont believe in carrying a fetus full term then termination before it take it first breath but i do believe that if a woman decides early on that she doesnt want the pregnancy it her body her choice
obviously shes not a believer because doctor can be hella wrong my cousin wa supposed to be a down syndrome and she came out normal god created that baby for a reason this couple is a coward and weak even if the child is born with the brain abnormality so what you still love the child and be there for the baby again god created this beautiful life for a reasonthe enemy know this child is powerful thats why he is trying to take him out parent get your butt into church and start learning about the lord and his miracle because obviously you have no clue how to live in this world this is a deep a i can hash it to yall i pray for your soul and i pray for that sweet precious baby inside you to turn out healthy like my cousin whom the doctor were wrong about
probably wouldnt have happened if the baby killer werent out celebrating murdering baby and putting on parade and stuff
this is more harmful than an abortion would be
abortion is no different than murder you want to legalize abortion you might just a well legalize murder you are an american you have the unenviable right to avoid all responsibility for your action even if you have to kill your own child in the womb before it is legally born is essentially legalized abortion incidentally my mom wanted to have an abortion when she wa carrying my sister in her womb but changed her mind after she got to the clinic she left the waiting room before it wa her turn i can not conceive of how different my life would be like if i had never known my sister and neither can my mom my sister also suffers from severe mental health issue shes lived for decade needing even the most basic care because she is incapable of taking care of herself but she is the sweetest human being weve ever known she ha saved our life with her cheerfulness more than once imagine how many good life will never be lived because they were deliberately severed in the womb before birth i can not feel any differently about this matter
my question is why all these gynaecologist were silent when the law were passed why some politician brainwashed by religion should be allowed to make such a choice are we going back to a stone age because this is definitely not a democracy when instead of medical professional we listen to religious demagogue
your perfectly free to travel out of texas for an abortion no one is forcing you to carry a baby nor to live in texas
i would carry that precious baby i lost my daughter at almost 4 month pregnant and got pregnant again and we lost that baby in you worry about carrying that baby i lost my daughter and the day she left this earth wa may 21st wish i had more time carrying because i still cry everyday and for our baby we just lost jan 15th i do anything to have them both back
it absolutely cruel these law are crazy to have no type of exception cant believe woman voted for that
this is such a tragedy for this family to go through a full term pregnancy just for more sadness in the end god protect this queen and her family
a a texan myself i feel sorry for all the woman living in this state
my heart can not handle another pregnancy
lol so youre telling me woman have to put their life and their kid life at risk over some dude being able to bust a bahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahah and woman still give it up all you have is to blame yourself no wonder they say woman are stpd
they voted pro life and now they are still against a woman right to choose but complaining that they have no choice here go figure
the decision regarding a woman womb need to be done by the woman and her medical caregiver only male who support this stance have a part in the discussion if you do not have a viable womb butt out if you are not a certified medical caregiver for the female butt out unless invited keep your praying prying protective and creepy hand off of a woman body
sound horrible but you reap what you sow
thats what you voted for now you want to leave the state to get an abortion what about the woman who cant afford to do that
i dont wan na see any shocked face
new mexico is a safe state still
there is nothing crazy about carrying a terminally ill living child to term hopefully it will form bond honor the baby life and provide closure there is no way around the sadness losing a baby is awful
omg how sad but be hard and omg this heart my soul
if the baby is dead or killing you then that is one story if it is a child that you dont want to care for selfish and a list if you decide to kill it
let just get the law out of woman uterus already side note it is interesting that we dont need to know if a trans person ha had surgery down there in order to respect there identity but yet we so openly have on trial woman uterus honestly it should just be between a woman and her gynecologist
move to california you can kill a baby at any age
stop voting for republican and you wont have this problem
this woman never expected to be at the receiving end of her own judgment
what i dont get is why is the husband afraid for his wife what would be different physically about giving birth to a baby who doesnt live long v one who doe
im very sorry for the loss you both must be feeling i hope that somehow despite the politics you can make your sweet baby boy feel all of your love for a long a he is growing and living i wish the outcome would have been different but if he is born and doe live with you for whatever time is his i hope he feel the love of his mom dad and you feel his love too
no word sending healing loving vibe your way
she want an abortion but doesnt think other woman should be able to choose one husband it not fair for her sir it is not fair for any woman
to me even though this woman realized her mistake she is still disturbing to me no one should be able to decide what happens in and to someone el body
personally id carry an give my son the best year he had on this earth with ton of love he wouldnt have to be perfect to the rest of the world
heartbreaking all the way around no one deserves this situation especially not that baby
well thank the pro life maga conservative for over turning roe v wade and passing these ban a if this wont affect real people
you get what you vote for unfortunately
i agree with her abortion is not birth control
in my country abortion are legal so i have no issue there but if state are going to make it illegal if the baby is not going to survive and will have no quality of life if it doe then teminations should be allowed for medical reasonseg brain dead child
yea it not a big enough issue to turn the abortion ban around sound like a 1 in 10000000 problem keep trying
i think abortion should be available for those woman who get raped but those that have a relationship and want abortion is wrong because in the first place there is protection and like this family just because the doc say something is wrong with the kid whether the kid ha mental or physical problem doe not mean get rid of the child it called being a parent and dealing with the kid
christian didnt think about this when they decided to push their dumb fake belief this is why idiot should not run or countrynation selfish greedy they shouldve known inbreeds would have issue like this cantcontroleverything
why do american still allow old white men to make decision and control an american woman life you cant cherry pick either your for it or against it
voting ha consequence maybe people will start to understand that they are subject to those consequence a well quit voting for candidate who feel it their right to dictate their illogical belief on everyone
fucking texas this woman just needed to shut up after 252 good riddance sorry you have to go through this but maybe stop being so rigid in your approach on dictating how other woman access healthcare so youre pro choice but only when it affect you ugh
this is so heartbreaking literally feel like we are in some horrendous show where people have no right over their own body
you got what you voted for enjoy
not even conservative christian want to be forced to carry nonviable baby to term yet these law are made by people who think their conservative christian base want this
many conservative are fond of calling a clump of cell in a woman uterus a child and of calling abortion murder i say democrat dont know how to rabblerouse like republican do how about demanding social security number for the clump of cell and that the irs code be amended to allow zygote embryo and fetus to be claimed a dependant on form 1040 and make that applicable to all pregnant taxpayer there are way to fight republican zealotry but democrat are too conventional in their approach
how funny it only matter when it happening to you the consequence of your vote
sue your state vote blue no law should touch your body or force you to harm your health husband dad bf you should stand up for your wife daughter friend
i say woman need to stop having sex if they want to avoid this situation or a normal pregnancy boycott sex woman there are toy if you want the big o
welcome to the real world you dont think other people should be titled to terminate an inadvertent pregnancy but it should be okay in your circumstance this is what happens when the state start sticking it nose into decision that really should be between a woman and her doctor
they want to play god
my son might be born disabled so let murder him
praying for baby boy
girl come to california we gotchu
if the baby put the mom life in serious danger then it must be killed to avoid the loss of 2 life otherwise the mom must carry on with the pregnancy you make your bed you sleep in it
so even if it already ha died and ha no brain and is essentially brain dead she wouldnt even be able to get a dc my mil got a dc right after she gave birth to my husband to get her tube tied this is ridiculous so she would basically have to have a still birth
now this is a medical reason for an abortion using it a birth control is what is disgusting
if men had to deal with carrying baby this would even be an issue
lol get fucked loser she literally voted for this she must have thought it through and put herself in other mother shoe no or wa she a nasty fucking devil who could see passed her own agenda
and this is why people who arent affected by the situation shouldnt have the power to vote on it give the vote to those mother who are actually facing these issue and we will be in a better world because of it
i dont understand why she couldnt get an abortion doe texas not have medical exemption could she not have gone to a different state
i get sick of the woman in this world that get pregnant and then with to go to a dr and kill it but will go to hell but i no one thing i dont talk date have sex or marry a what that kill a baby dont care about what people say that u me i want
im so grateful to live in colorado even a a christian we need to save viable life not force others to suffer
youre either for abortion or you are not in all case sick of people only caring when it involves them
it may sound sick but maybe the texas mom should have her delivery on the floor of the texas state house while theyre in session so they can see the horror theyve created
if the baby is already not going to live why rush to kill it before it born the little boy will die naturally after birth
question doe this harm the mom to give birth to the baby who not developed like other baby doe this type of birth put her life at risk
people absolutely shouldnt have to do this not in this day and age and truly they dont unless of course they happen to live in a random geographical locale where some politician ha decided that they are going to be in charge of these decision for u regardless of their lack of education on any of the real issue related to these ludicrous law this should never happen not ever this is just one more great example of why they want you believe they are passing these law because in the majority of case abortion is just used a a horrific form of birth control so you know hurry up and take that away but the truth is in reality those instance represent a very low number of case and even then they still have that right to make that decision for themselves unfortunately the reality is that a large percentage of abortion procedure a term which encompass a wide array of treatment are performed to end a pregnancy that wa very much wanted thats what everyone listening to their rhetoric and constantly repeated sound bite supporting these law doesnt even try to understand until it affect them or their loved one which at some point will happen to everyone we are smarter than this people come on
in a rare situation like this the baby will be born terminally ill and will likely be on life support until it pass i dont see why so many people belive thats any different than a person of any age being on life support or in hospice care until they pas it always terrible for a person to suffer and die and it awful for the family member to go through it but we dont just kill everyone who terminal thats so sad why kill the baby
anyone notice neither of the couple used the word abortion and kept using the word it or procedure accept reality and the fact that you are pro life but want an abortion who want to make their own decision for their own body now the hypocrisy in this video is remarkable
this is so heartbreaking sad for everyone involvedthis family is traumatized enough finding out their baby will not survive and then to be told the law is forcing everyone to suffer more is horrific im sorry for this family
say yes to live is always the right thing to do god will blessed you and your family instead of saying procedure say abortion and see how you feel we woman are to give life and take care of the human being when is in the most fragile stage in life we woman should be against abortion god created u to give life not to terminated be open to life and receive blessing for every little angel
i work em in texas and actually ran a call for a 35 year old woman who ha this same disease after she pulled her trach tube out she wa in a total vegetative state absolutely no mean of communication or sign of cognitive function she couldnt even localize to object with her eye her entire 35 year existence ha been laying in bed breathing through a tube and being fed through a g tube with a suprapubic catheter to catch her urine she ha to be turned every few hour in bed for her entire life to prevent pressure ulcer shes never been able to talk walk speak sit up or even eat on her own i remember thinking to myself how miserable it must be to live like that and i wondered if her parent knew before she wa born of her condition and why they wouldnt choose to terminate if so seems like it would have been the far more merciful thing to do now thanks to the scotus parent dont even get to make that quality of life decision for their kid what a nightmare were living in
this kind of news is crushing enough to force this woman or any woman to maintain this kind of pregnancy for another 4 month is beyond criminal
she should have gotten denied she can vote to get rid of people right but when it come to her it ok
this so what yall voted for why are yall upset
the only way to solve this problem is to vote democrat there is only one political party that will ensure that woman have the choice and the option available to them to safety handle any pregnancy complication that may arise and it certainly not the republican party
this is a lack of good judgment and descernment by medical staff
well you asked for it
the system is so fucked up so they will not allow her to abort but are willing to let her give birth to a child that will die no later than 1 yr after birth make it make sense america
a lot of valid criticism in the comment but i really feel for this couple and it is a good thing for everyone that they are coming out with their story
the doctor said the baby wa nonviable doctor have been proven wrong before i wouldnt have an abortion there always the chance that nothing will be wrong nobody perfect i would love the baby no matter what only god should take a life away heartbreaking but no doctor would have the right to tell me to have an abortion god bless this baby to be perfect enough for these parent
oh well you reap what you sow
this is outrageous filled with rage that woman have lost the right over their own body and now will be left traumatized over situation just like this one lawmaker should be ashamed of themselves
this is sensationalism read the law for yourselves ive read them
im snitching and collecting the moola if she abort in big texas chaooo you get what you vote for pow
there need to be exception for stuff like this i think it should be allowed anyway but if not at least allow exception for emergency like this
sad proof that no life exist without a birth in brainno bible quote say anything abortion specially in political law
dont orient the conversation to support murder woman culture insistent of murder to child within the womb ha directly increased murder of child outside the womb evil is not an opinion karma is unrelenting
if it aint broke dont fix it let the lawsuit begin so victim can get a million from tax payer money if only came from politician sad
wait until all the compassionate obgyns leave the state so they make medically necessary decision with their patient and not with politician who have zero business doing so this woman and her husband had the mean to go to another state although by that time it wa too late but how many woman and girl have to suffer with no hope before bodily autonomy right to privacy and separation of church and state are given back to them
if you turn it over to the lord he will take care of everything
so your beliefsvotes actively caused this so very sad
she think she ha the right to tell other people what they can do but she get to chose what a dope
her comment indicate shes one of those conservative that didnt think this could happen
a fetus without a brain is no longer a baby much le a pregnancy it isnt even compatible with life no brain no heartbeat once the mother circulatory system stop working to keep the fetus from rotting this is ridiculous and if people knew how toxic a necrotic dying fetus inside a mother wa they would terminate this lethal mass of flesh inside this woman immediately
they are the adult they are not the victim this child is the victim and the one who will suffer their son will die either way this is not love or concern or wellmeaning or good this is purely selfish
lmfao nature way of saying fu to the toxic human specie the human animal will suffer the consequence of ignorance lol i came into early menopause at 37 because of how toxic a civilization we live in and wa never selfish enough to subject any of my would be offspring to the rest of you savage so a far a im concerned im no longer at risk of being a forced broodmare for the state lol
the right to terminate a pregnancy should remain a right
this is why politician should not make any law that have to do with healthmedical
no efffsss giving since more than likely it sure look they voted for that
this simultaneously break my heart but also enrages me like how could she be going through this but also still be so against abortion she doesnt support it a birth control yet she cant see the problem that arise when doctor arent allowed to be doctor a she is learning she cant have it both way the state need to leave medical procedure to practitioner and patient it a case by case basis thing are not black and white and politician should not be able to police a woman body with these law something is very wrong here people seem to forget we dont live in a damn theocracy
she is the type of person who deserves this
ok but 20 week it too far along plane and simple you do realize that the procedure for abortion at 20 week is essentially partly giving birth right and non viable pregnancy no non viable mean baby wouldnt even make it through delivery
1 in 10k is not an anomaly you demented lunaticthats a lot of deformity lady what drug is she on tryping to pas that off a a small occurrence and thats without stating the fact this country ha the highest of wealthy nation of woman dying from childbirth a if there is infinite space and resource on this planet of 8 billion dysfunctional savagewith what information is available one would be so inclined to say that you people deserve to suffer the consequence of selfserving ignorancewhen the chance are higher for having deformed offspring than the chance for winning the lottery then i would say that is not an anomaly and from a doctor no le lol no wonder the quality of people there are in society when socalled educated people say 1 in 10k of deformed offspring is an anomalythis lady is either downplaying the severity or highly questionable when it come to math either way this speaks volume
but i wa told this didnt happen did the probirth camp s
oh well thats the preferred law in texas this is exactly what they wanted
nah but you guy dont want abortion right you shouldve stayed in texas with all the other trump supporter hypocrite
not deemed for birth control but now that she need she is okay with it
he still a person i would gladly love him a long a he life poor little guy
what prodeath to human being abc wont show you are the 1000 of woman who choose adoption or at first wanted an abortion but carried the baby to term and now say it wa the best decision theyve ever made
im being punished now with their undesirable whining not going to let my cat belly go it skin
who using abortion a birth control it cost hundred of dollar so it not the poor
theyre always whining about me needing healthcare and help but theyve gotten rid of abortion in many place even though im an adult me bringing a kid into the world is child abuse especially in the u most people have no idea how hard it is to do simple thing because of all the roadblock we have to do more than normal people too and we can only live if we do quantum physic im not kidding the place i live in become bunker and a war zone the u cant be civil about anything i have to be hunted and in hell for im evil i asked to be sterilized they would not do it ive only had one true boyfriend for like 6 month due to how i wa treated i dont like dealing with the crowd of cliche they want me to join the mass i cant they did it to me theyll never say sorry cry me a river
thats sound like your problem sweetheart you know you voted so enjoy your nonviable baby
who get to select the reason it is necessary thats why it should always be up to the woman and not to other people religious belief and politician
i pray in jesus name that god make a miracle out of that baby boy and that he born healthy with a fully funtional brain and that this family ha beautiful testimony out of this read the book god want you well and watch the youtube testimony of the many negative ultrasound that turned into miracle in him
you dont need to go to mexico where it could be unsafe or end up with a serious infection if you need medical abortion and your life is in danger go to canada they will help you and it safe you will be taken care of this also affect ivf egg donation sperm donor surrogate mother making people who battle infertility impossible to ever have any child because no one will be donating with ban law a ridiculous a this in the usa did anyone even think of that when making this ridiculous law
a life is a life and just because they dont want to go through the pain of losing him they are willing to put him through pain and kill him i mean really everyone want to tip toe around the word abortion and how it is actually done the fact that you are choosing to kill your child because you dont want to live with the consequence of your act of having sex regardless of that child health issue is heart breaking and evil that child deserves to be loved and wanted regardless of how abnormal he is and lastly you are either prolife or prochoice there is no gray or in between area murder is murder we have killed more unborn baby in this country than hitler did during world war 2 and that is is sad i pray we stop acting like we are god and start acting more human with empathy and compassion we are all give trial and tribulation and our true color shine by how we choose to act and handle them
i hope this woman sue the state of texas for pain and suffering
im sure california would do ti asap and for free
if they had made me carry to term i would still have a dead fetus inside of me right now lmao this is insane
apart from a 230 year old document that wa used to justify slavery and deny the woman the right to vote doe anyone have anything else beyond pure pragmatism to justify killing a developing human in the womb but not outside the womb by the way a non viable developing human isnt alive hence this story ha zero to do with being pro life
he had a brain a brain not dividing is way different than not having a brain still terribly sad
people dont care until it happening to them body autonomy should be a human right
sound more than nonviable if it can survive for even up to a year after being born
pro choice here i am not shocked this is happening i am shocked she still belief she ha any right to deem when abortion is or isnt necessary both of you are dumb and could not make the final stretch if an abortion in colorado cost 1015k it highly probable that abortion can not feasibly be used a frequent a birth control however even if abortion wa why would we force them to carry a child they dont want
my heart wa restarted twice with adenosine and me and my baby were on bed rest for three month while our heart rate dropped and i had to lay there helplessly a she wa on my sciatic nerve and killed the nerve to my knee i started the pregnancy doing 5ks and ended up not being able to walk in a wheelchair i literally used my body my choice to try to get the doctor to take her out early when she wa viable enough to save her life over mine while they were restarting my heart with adenosine for the second time and it wasnt working and she wa losing oxygenation to the brain because they didnt take her out she is nonverbal and will never speak or have a normal life they did not respect my wish a her mother to save her before me even though i have a lifethreatening illness and she had a full healthy life ahead of her if they had listen to me it not our body or our choice theyve chosen for u
stop voting republican
i had a missed miscarriage at 3 month i still had to carry my baby 2 week after finding out my baby had passed away inside me those 2 week were horrible i cant imagine having to carry the baby until full term
prayer to the family
it still murder no matter what it situation is
we are not a free country anymore if i wa still in my twenty i would be looking for an exit any way i could find good luck lady we are no longer safe
pro life people act like medical issue with pregnancy are something rare when they are in fact so common then they are surprised when it happens to them or someone they know when something is going wrong with your pregnancy the last thing you want to do is fight with the law few woman actually choose to get an abortion and most of those woman who do are either teenager or below the poverty level the fast majority it easy to say not to get an abortion when you may end up homeless if you dont
society need to stop pushing their belief on everyone else mind your own business and keep my body out of your business and leave my body in my business where it belongs
this is a medical issue and should have been delt with medically the dr who did not deal with it wa negligent
god work in really mysterious waysreally really mysterious way
im glad i got my abortion back in 2017 before this ban nothing wa wrong with the fetus i just didnt want it
whats more tragic is that it clear they were pro life voter you dont care until something like this is forced upon you
why dont you abc look into the medical reason for her carrying to term rather than slicing her child up and sucking them out of her body or tearing them out a leg at a time birth is a natural process whether or not the baby are alive abortion is not natural unless it is spontaneous through miscarriage this could have ended up with a dead mother a well a still born baby
she shouldnt have had sex abstinence is the only way not to get pregnant another then he woman who actually cant get pregnant which that is really sad woman how can get pregnant are taking advantage of that she could be stupid and go have a backdoor abortion
my heart go out to this woman the pain she ha to endure is enormous can you just imagine the pain a baby yes a baby endures during abortion easier not to think about that isnt it
so sorry
im sure even with the brain being the way it is this baby would still feel the pain during an abortion at it fetal stage thank god texas is saving these poor baby from painful murder
pure evil someone who want to kill their innocent precious baby that they created that god wanted them to have for a reason
oh oh it wa because god and republican loved it so much it had to go to heaven before it wa born
republican we want le government intrusion in our life also republican make the government ban abortion
boohoo pro life conservative texas woman cant in her own opinion kill her unborn baby big whoop she even judged other woman in this interview this is sweet karma
despicable that a woman healthcare decision are being made by the government patriarchy in all it glory a major set back to woman a return to day when woman ha no right
everyone need to stop controlling woman body
american freedom a husband and wife can not choose abortion to protect the wife health but they can own a many gun a they want
im sorry they are going through that i think it sad that no one feel like this baby life is worth it is it traumatic and horrifying to find out your child life expectancy is a year after birth of course but many baby sadly die from sids or get diagnosed with fatal medical condition after birth and they dont live very long should we terminate all pregnancy if we know the child wont ever become an adult no if it not unsafe to the mother to carry i dont understand why she feel the need to terminate the baby life that baby is beautiful and precious and matter even if we know his life will be short im praying he is healed in jesus name and that the next scan they will see his brain is forming the way is should be
the family shouldnt have ever been in a situation where they werent in control of her reproductive right if you dont want an abortion then dont have one but it isnt the place of the government to regulate any woman uterus ever
the child deserves to be delivered naturally and feel loved until he passesthats the right thing to do shes not in distress but the baby would be
woman reproductive right are going to the dark age and still they vote for the stupidest people that make these law
this make me mad how dare the government make this family suffer with knowing they have a child that will not live they want her to carry full term
what about the mental cruelty she ha to endure oh my god horrific
the majority voted in the politician that bought these type of non exempt law to the table and instead of the public thoroughly examining the bill before siding yes or no blindly this is what we get so we all live with the outcome until further notice in the state where it is illegal let not expect any change too soon
every life is valuable every life god give and take away life wanting to abort even a nonviable baby mean missing out on joy lesson growth and grace that god can provide in such a tragic situation that baby ha an eternal soul and is precious
so beyond stupid ignorance of texas
if anyone deserves this it literally her she knew nothing about medicine and decided abortion wa bad and now she know 1 thing about medicine and think she should be exempt from the rule she voted for come on
well i hope more conservative folk will listen to this lovely couple from texas this poor family the poor baby reverse the overturn of roe v wade thank god i live in california although i myself would not get an abortion unless i wa in a situation where my life or the baby are in jeopardy a situation like these people are going through but i still believe that abortion must be legal especially today you cant possibly think that no sex ed in school plus no abortion is really a good idea
i feel for them she ha to carry the child full term only to see her beloved child with disability and deformity and then to see the child die thats a lot and if she get postpartum depression thats even worse
sad i had to get an abortion year ago because i wa having difficulty i had to make a decision loose the child myself or u both in danger of dying i choose abortion i already had 2 toddler a new husband it would not of been fair for them loosing a mother at such a young age nor my husband loosing his wife
this whole situation is scary and woman being rape are getting pregnant early smh what happens now
religious turd making law about crap they know nothing about typical right wing stupidity
are there really dumb people who believe that someone use abortion for birth control
that people have to do this do what i dont mean to be insensitive but that child will have a full brain in heaven and is a complete person here on earth whether in his mother womb or outside of it
such a sad story imagine this being your wife your sister your daughter how would you feel about it would it change your mind i am prochoice our government ha no business in our private affair i mean if a woman is out there using abortion a birth control perhaps there should be repercussion but most woman have an abortion because they feel they have to not because they want to it done out of necessity this is just crazy how big is our government going to get how many aspect of our life do they get to control
i love how all the men whove never been woman have the most to say the fetus doesnt have a brain how else can a human live without a brain no brainimminent death
thank a republican
im sorry for your situation
woman have had to do this even before roe v wade wa over turned please research people becmsm is just playing on your fear n outrage
so doctor ha said your health is not in jeopardy and the baby is alive god gave you this baby to love for however long he life making this stance for abortion when you dont believe in it is a shame now proaborts will use your baby and your story to kill many baby needlessly please pray about why you are doing this and whose future besides your own you are affecting
man that ban what a setback
dont feel sorry for you you voted to overturn roe v wade so live with your choice
every human ha value even the one people will deem nonviable it not up to u to play god and destroy that life
could idk go 1 state over it go state to state
you know i had sympathy for them until their comment about disagreeing with abortion a a form of birth control give big my abortion is the only moral abortion energy pointless gatekeeping and splitting hair about which type of abortion are justifiable is why america is in the mess that it in they were quite happy to feel smug in the fact that they would never have to deal with an unintended pregnancy but now the draconian anti abortion law attitude like theirs have supported have meant that they are now in an awful situation
i think i know whats going on i dont know how to put this in exact word but nobody in their right mind is going to do this to another human being unless they are using these poor mother to show you the downside so well that we agree to reinstate the abortion law i have a feeling this is not an accident that they put that innocent poor woman though that without it standing for something the government is actually really smart and sick for this if what im thinking is true im starting to think texas is showing you the actual permanent cruelty making woman go through birth regardless of the mother well being i am personally against getting rid of the abortion and story like this really just confirms why this is a bad idea to make abortion illegal to begin with if the government is going to be this heartless which is on purpose for a purpose i can assure you than we really dont need to get rid of abortion this is to much and it sickening you have to lock me up in prison cause i wouldnt have made her go through that that would have been a big fat yes approval to abort the baby and save the mother these reason right here is why people need to leave abortion alone and stop trying to control everything and everyone this is ridiculous and not okay abortion is very personal and very hard and frankly it nobody business i would never get an abortion unless im in a situation like this beautiful mother but i dont find it appropriate for anyone to judge a person getting an abortion it nobody business we all are never going to see eye to eye on this but one thing for sure putting mother through this is uncalled for regardless of the point they are trying to make yall really dropping the ball on this id rather save the mother from heartbreak and devastation she would have to go through after all this my answer will always be the same keep abortion legal can somebody please make it illegal to hound the abortion clinic is what really need to happen it nobody business i get it save the child but we cant even take care of all the american foster child already and yall want more i can smell the stupidity from here
welcome to texas
oh so because it may only live for a year it worth killing sooner hm
the forced birth zealot will love this they have no regard for the woman feeling or health she is nothing to them but a birthing vessel and she loses her bodily autonomy by law and she will be owned by the state until she give birth
thank the old white men in your state lady
are his other organ viable and working your baby could save so many other baby life
people like them are the reason that those law exist they wont even say the word abortion and that woman think that there are people who use abortion instead of birth control no one doe that they are clearly misogynistic republican who didnt care until it affected them
it necessary if it for my benefit but it shouldnt be allowed for others the hypocrisy is real
252 a soon a she said that it made me realize she is apart of the reason her and other woman in her state are struggling to access this type of medical care she wanted to ban all abortion she only had a problem with her stance when she realized it would affect her life it not up to anybody else to make these decision about a person body only the person who is pregnant hope this experience expands her perspective edit grammar
im glad you are sharing your story and helping to shine light on how these barbaric law will effect people in reality how your vote matter who you chooseto lead definitely matter
could she not drive to another state
i couldnt watch this bc i immediately started to tear up 10 year ago my boyfriend and i decided we wanted to have a baby well i schedueled an apointtment they did a test said it wa positive and sent me to a different hospital i thought it wa normal bc this hospital wa basically for sick and emergency well the second apointment they told me there were two heart beat and i would have to go to a high risk hospital after my next visit with them my next visit wa a glucose test and after that we were sent to a hospital about 1hr away from where we lived this is where we found out just how high risk our twin pregnancy wa they told u from the jump that this would go week by week we had weekly visists and each visit theyd say next week we might have both we might have one or well loose both but let hope for the best i lost one at 22 week my body went into labor and i had the second twin living he lived for about 1 hr and the other wa still born their name are elijah gabriel i had no option to have the still born twin i had to carry him a long a my body would let me and that wa le than 24hrs had i made it 24 week i would have been admitted into the hospital for the ramainder of my pregnancy i can research twin pregnancy all day long and figure out a game plan but you never know what will happen nothing can stop what is to come if your doing everything right to care for your unborn child not drinking not doing drug taking your vitamin eating they said one of my twin wasnt getting what he needed the living twin weighed more than he did i took my vitamin and ate a my dr directed and still one passed away no one could have controlled how much went to which twin so i think it ignorant for people in the comment to say nobody care about what shes going through or she should have thought about this before to the people who dont want to abort their child they dont think about the abortion law bc it not something they want to do however if you are in a situation like this there should be an option to do so if the baby ha passed on and your body isnt going into labor maybe the doctor can induce you idk if that is apart of the law that the dr cant induce a pregnancy but if the baby ok i stopped typing and watched the video this is very sad how doe a baby or person live with no brain maybe this ultrasound is wrong it ha happened ive been there where i wa only able to hold my baby for an hour until he took his last breath he wasnt developed enough and the hospital didnt have any supply this wa supposed to be the high risk pregnancy hospital this wa the place they sent people for high risk pregnancy if st jude and leboner can save a baby at 20 week then why couldnt this high risk pregnancy hosptial try to save mine at 22 week i didnt fight because i felt in my heart it wa time to let him go he went to heaven with his twin brother i knew it wa time in that moment to say goodbye i love both of them 3 two month later i found out i wa having another baby and her name is lailah shes 8 now 3 i can only imagine trying to care for a baby that is possibly be none responsive knowing at any moment he or she could be gone idk what i would do in that situation having been through something not so the same before but right now i would say id carry the baby and enjoy what time i did have with him or her hold them snuggle them bc either way that is your baby it sound so awful to say i dont want my baby bc he doesnt have a brain saying it that way doe sound bad but listen to them they wanted a baby they dont want to abort their child but now they are preprocessing the loss of their unborn child their child wont live past a year based off of statistic and the baby will essentially be lifeless it sad either way you go about it but the baby is developing he growing he just doesnt have a brian so i understand that he is living and you cant terminate a living baby so id say carry the baby to term and enjoy the time you do have with him hold your baby and love him bc any second he could pas away
she know that i have a hard time controlling it it just she wasnt expecting it to stop no but she just wanted me to learn that behaviour is not ok you know like sometimes people with mental disorder have behaviour and violent behaviour that they cant control sometimes but even if you know that you still should put a consequence on that behavior even though he might or she might not be able to control it she or he can at least learn that ok yes this behaviour isnt ok and i need help you know yes i still had violent outburst but thats not the point the point is that i knew it wa wrong i eventually learned that yes i cant control it but instead of hitting i could do you know get a counsellor or do you something you know so that i dont act that way in the future thats why she created a consequence because she wa hoping that i would acknowledge that and try to get somebody to help me deal with it you know and it worked i havent been violent for quite a few year you know because im not in a situation where i feel like i have to pound the life out of somebody you know im not in that situation so a long a i dont get put in that situation you should never see me get physically andor emotionally violent again because thats a problem if i do end up living in a place where somebody screaming or yelling you know when they get mad or upset and it also why theyre getting upset too thats what tick me off right like i had a roommate that used to get mad and hed yell and swear at the support staff for trying to help him do his laundry he would get very rude and belligerent if somebody tried to help him with some thing sometimes i dont even think he wa angry sometimes i think he just like to behave like that i know sometimes i think he liked the idea of looking tougher you know instead of just saying no i dont need any help with that thank you very much though you were very very very kind to try to help me you know that wouldve been the proper way you know and most people do get ticked off and yeah they do they can get physically violent but most people choose not to do that right but with me it isnt a choice you may ask ok if you cant control getting violent then why havent you done that for a few year now well let me explain that it because i know i cant help it and because im so scared that i will end up in serious trouble you know that i just try to avoid those situation you know because i know i cant i might be not able to control my action in the moment so i always like somebody to go with me so that if that happens i can just tell them ok let get the heck out of here you know that if i were to be on my own you know it would be much harder because yes i could leave and i have before too a well but it wasnt a quick thinking i wa actually thinking should i get involved or should i just walk away because i really wanted to do you know if somebody wa being mean to somebody i really want to step in there and save them but you know my counsellor that i have now say that you know if they were to be like that it better off that wait until they leave and then go up and see if the person is ok and offer them support because if i went to that person and i started it all yelling and screaming in his face or her face then i would be just a bad a he is or she is you know and i dont want to look that way i dont want to look like an idiot i dont want that person that is being treated badly to look at me and i think i am being a bully and not the other person you know because thats exactly what they would think you know they would think im pulling the bully and then all the attention will be on me and i would be in big trouble i would be being a bully not the other person so it just good to wait until theyre done and left and then you go up to the person and ask them if theyre ok and offer support and say to the person that you didnt deserve what happened you know that wa completely rude you know and then that way theyre still feeling that support from me without being a bully you know
i wonder if the antiabortionist do listen to medical professional about health
election have consequence it all sounded good until it affected her and her life and only then doe she feel it should be available under certain circumstance
by her own abortion arent birth control logic she shouldnt be given an abortion that baby is still alive and the doctor didnt deem it medically necessary her own lack of compassion for others is officially her problem and that suck i hope others learn from this and start voting in the best interest of the public not just what they think benefit them at the time or in the interest of controlling other people
ive done this i never thought boy i want an abortion i knew what wa going on i knew the outcome i also knew god would support me through this im sorry shethey all struggled with this i know the pain of loss either way grief is involved
oh god alobar holoprosencephaly is extreme in some case the baby have one eye in the middle of their face and no nose
i thought joe biden wa going to make abortion possible but again you people mustve voted for that lady who wanted she wa so against people you know doing bad thing that she obviously didnt want abortion i forget what her name wa i dont want to know because people like that make me sick you know i mean there people that dont want to have kid and dont wan na give birth because they just cant handle probably what they hear on a daily basis like they dont want their child to end up a school shooter or you know a person who kill more than more people add an event on like sometimes in barrie they would have fair and that they usually have a fair that go on in the summer at the waterfront and people just like to ruin that for kid and their family and friend to like lot of teenager go there with their friend and have fun and have a ball no just a bunch of innocent people just going to have fun thats all but people like to use that opportunity you know to kill them at that fair you know thank god that hasnt happened yet thank the lord but youre starting to hear more and more and more that now you know would like the july 4 shooting that one wa bad i think a little boy like five or six year old maybe even younger had lost his parent you know i think his dad i think the boy and his mom and dad are watching the parade and just like everybody else you know they were killed lotta people were killed that day you know so yeah it very very very scary you know so im disgusted that doctor cant do anything to stop a baby from growing in your belly because i know in canada abortion is legal and i dont know why in the state people dont have the option of abortion because i dont think itll change the fact that lot and lot and lot of people will still have kid you know i think there so so so many people that would at least adopt do you know kid from other country so it doesnt make sense to me that abortion is banned because you know there lotta kid for adoption do you know nobody ha to give birth you know i mean when you adopt a child youre basically signing lot and lot and lot of paperwork and signing document saying that that child is now yours you know it exact same thing if you were to give birth because you have to sign paper in that too you know there a lot that go into pregnancy probably just the same amount a you were to adopt do you know what you need to have a room toy depending on how young the child is you have to buy clothing you know so it still a much work a it is to you know get pregnant you know and plus i think youre allowed to have some say thats the only difference is that youre allowed you know youre allowed to have the same a to what personality of the child youre looking for and you know how friendly you want them to be like if youre a mother and a father who like to go out and enjoy boat ride and traveling you would want to adopt a child that would enjoy that too you know yeah giving birth you dont always have that choice you know you got like a 5050 chance that you know youre taking your chance and when you give birth sometimes child grow up and they arent very nice and did you get into lot of trouble sometimes they dont care about how their parent feel like half of the school shooter or mass murder probably have a very loving family and that will never never never except violence in their house i know my parent dont you know they never agreed with violence of any kind i mean if i had to leave from school because of my violent behavior then she will have consequence for me and she sure did you know she didnt put up with any of that even though she know i cant help it right
this woman experience wa cruel and inhumane
the government trying to tell woman what to do with their body is so wrong and so screwed up to make a woman carry a baby to term that ha something wrong with him and they know he going to die can cause death to the mother a well and if thats the case the husband should be able to sue the government for basically killing his wife if it wasnt the government that got a woman pregnant then they shouldnt have any say about what the woman doe with her own body
they should consider suing the state for mental health issue and for medical cost
forced birth is murder
if only yall can treat gun law like abortion law gun take more life than abortion do another distraction from focusing on real issue instead of banning abortion entirely exactly how your wont ban gun intirely you use the excuse it for our safety well abortion can come at a woman safety men so youre prioritizing yourself over another human being men do it every single day in power you egotistical muts get over yourselves men are continuously trying to tell woman what to do with their body youre not the one pushing out the baby youre not the one carrying for 9 month youre not the one on the delivery bed shut up honestly if you cant carry than you arent part of this conversation at this point regardless ban it if you want youre just causing people to move out of your shitty state which is something my family had to do because she wasnt able to have an emergency abortion due to the fetus egg wa stuck in the fallopian tube due that that the baby would either not grow properly if it doe pas through at a later point my sister wa at high risk of death during birth or the baby could possibly miscarriage a it not possible for an egg to grow in the fallopian tube so to leave that fetus inside of her till term disgusting gun kill way more people than abortion do wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy more remove gun than you can continue the abortion debate but till than lady move get out of there go someone were people care about you and prioritize your safety why risk your life a confirmed one over a potential life be smart dont let them brain wash you with this nonsense fetus are not alive a fetus doesnt even have lung fully working until approx 2628 week so even if there wa an emergency anything prior to that the baby wouldnt even survive without life saving device why would you even want your child to live life like that it sad really be smart lady remember we are the brain use it dont let these muts brainwash you we know our body better than they ever will
america home of the free smh
abortion is most used in the state a birth control sickening many prayer for this family never forget god is great all the time have faith you will make it thru this
the southern border is bringing turmoil to our country these main stream medium news is on china side they dont give a fat rat ass china doll news anchor report cow farted before border crisis it doe not fit the anti american narrative msm is on our adversary side
it so sad that the government think they can get involved in our health and well being
the entire antiabortion issue is driven by religion and religion is make believe end of discussion engage with reality it will happen and legal safe
she chose to have a pregnancy of course not all pregnancy are the same if the child is dead it is a miscarriage if the child is alive then it a forced miscarriage also known a an abortion in other country they have wiped out the disable kid since the doctor see the fetus not developing properly and advice to have an abortion or it would look bad this is only the second case that ha happened and just need a bit more research it doe not happen that often therefore making it not necessarily to reverse the antiabortion law
if this woman were to die from complication of the forced pregnancyher family should be able to sue each and every political figure thus owning the state of tx in the end
medical advance are allowing baby to be createdbut there are case where one or both parent have biological issue that would never bring forth a child medically assisted fetus that turn out to be in this case broken should not be held under this ridiculous new law
ive lost hope for america good luck everyone
to anyone outraged by this and other recent supreme court ruling if you were too busy or disinterested to vote in 2016 this is on you
no brain baby thats exactly what republican want someone just a stupid a the rest of them
thank the holier than thou brainless gop may they suffer far worse instance of pain suffering than these countless parent are forced to endure
most people who are anti abortion think it used a birth control when it not used that way no one us it that way people get abortion because they need to like it not fair when they were the one to vote for anti abortion
poor family
i cant believe that people still believe in the myth that abortion is used a birth control no it not think about it logically is it logical to spend hundred of dollar to get an abortion when you can spend a few buck on birth control thats essentially what youre saying jesus christ
texas ha decided to take control of woman life im so sorry you have to deal with this
so wrong on so many levelswtf
i hope and pray that baby is born perfectly normal and they have a healthy baby god is always good no matter what amen
woman are now second class citizen in state where abortiion is not allowed wo legal safe abortion woman will die we must be allowed to make our own decision i come from the era before roe and had to get a safe if illegal abortion i wa lucky but my granddaughter who is 19 may not be if this woman can get to california or washington she will be ok i encourage you to do everything you can to get to a state that is legal
how is this not considered mental emotional and physical abuse of a mother and mental and emotional abuse of the father
did they vote republican to support these antiabortion law before finding out her baby wa not gon na make it
so did she end up having her son or is she still carrying him in her womb we need the whole story abcnot just some of it besidesthis baby could prove drs wrong and live past 1 year and so on it just mean he may not be able to walk or talk and feed himself it not a big deal if he ha to sit in a wheelchair and be fed with a feeding tube device hundred of child are born every day with medical issue like cerebral palsy that make them invalid for life and their parent didnt abort them in vitro just because they didnt know and thought their life no matter how long and short were worthless and a waste because they cant be normal
i am conservative but i am pro choice i believe it wrong to force people to go through something like this it not loving someone make a go fund me for her to get her the 15k to get it done in colorado
cool story bro
i wonder how they voted
no matter what the reason for an abortion is it healthcare that should be universally available to everyone who ha a uterus all reason are valid reproductive healthcare choice should not be regulated by politician youre moral and value most likely based on religious upbringing have no bearing on another person healthcare
the best thing to do is have the baby fruit of the love between you and your husband they wanted a baby and now his imperfection give them cause to doubt their first idea their marriage will thrive if they can accept this imperfect child and love him even for the short time he life watch video on youtube about how to get through this and enjoy the blessing of the child
if shes not an advocate for birth control and is prolife why is she bitching she wasnt forced she chose to vote for law that made this her reality
this poor lady how is it right to keep someone suffering like this these new law have just caused craziness
no sympathy for this family they voted for these law with no compassion and in the video still made it clear that the only moral abortion is theirs
exactly i may never choose to terminate personally but i will never vote against a woman right to choose
why are people in the comment getting so crazed with her statement of personally not for it for the way of birth control thats a very fair statement because there are people who dont use any kind of birth control and theyll get an abortion every time i dont believe that abortion should be for that you should prevent yourself from getting pregnant not get yourself pregnant and get rid of it this situation this woman is in isnt wanting an abortion because she never wanted to be pregnant the baby isnt going to live and it got no brain thats a legitimate reason for needing to end a pregnancy people are basically saying you cant have your cake and eat it too but thats not what she want stop looking at accidental pregnancy and a harmful condition a the same thing
there a scene in it always sunny in philadelphia where one of the main character mac dog get pregnant and the only way the dog would survive is with abortion for some preface mac is hyper religious and pro life his response to the vet when he said that the puppy would need to be terminated wa to go through with the abortion to save the dog life a second main character wa at the vet with mac when he made that comment and charlie said i thought you were against abortion mac reply oh yeah but this situation effect me in short people always want to have an opinion until theyre effected by it
back to the medieval age i guess
so sad the country is crazy cruel and controlling
abortion is healthcare
family planning law need to ensure that they take into account medical need for mom and baby this isnt a black and white issue non viable pregnancy should be an exception to restrictive law it already heartbreaking enough knowing a baby wont live to birth or shortly after to risk the mom life is too much
this is exactly what happens when woman try to dictate the term in which we can abort abortion is abortion you dont get cooky for using it for medical reason v for a lack of reading or financial wherewirhal im not happy that shes going through it but the fact that she draw a line of distinction between motivation is hypocrisy let that fetus run it lifeterm since abortion is wrong she chose to get pregnant so thats her burden to bare smh i hope no one wa too dense to catch the sarcasm
cant do anything unless her health is in jeopardy imagine the stress and anguish she experienced and what health consequence that ha
this is cruel to both the mother and the child inside her this should definitely qualify for a legal abortion tbh the only time i think abortion should be illegal is for those woman who just keep on having them they should be forced to have long effected birth control and then i of course dont believe abortion should occur after 23 week unless the baby is gravely ill or severely disabled where they would always be dependent of others medicine etc or if the mother is gravely ill where continuing with the pregnancy would kill her there are different circumstance that need to be review abortion should never be a flat out yes or no
this make me so angry vote blue vote blue vote blue this is absolutely inhumane outrageous
everyone always ha an excuse for killing their baby maybe you should just keep your leg closed
so sad just because these people want to force their religion on you people have to go through this
you are not carrying a nonviable pregnancy you are carrying a child who will most likely not survive sound like youre prochoice and using your very small case le than 3 percent to justify the majority of case of abortion
nobody is for abortion for birth control stop believing the propaganda
i always say you cant play a victim when you vote for this suck it up and deal with it because thats what you thought when voting
this is still a very rare case in abortion while most case are just people who dont take responsibility in case like these i believe there should be exception
this is basically a late miscarriage what the hell is wrong with ppl
i feel sorry for them but i have to say i have seen 100 of miracle of baby fully recovered when born what if that happens for their baby there is a purpose and a plan for everything when my mom wa pregnant with my sister on the ultrasound they saw everything that could possibly be wrong and that she would die too she came out miraculously healed of every single medical issue they saw i know there is a chance that might not happen for them but there is another chance it can i believe in prayer and miracle
well if i hadnt been to a woman conference having the wife of the leader of the upci and what i heard awful thing said that if governor abbott doesnt see thing our way we remind him while one of u push his wheelchair towards the stairwell so theyre you have why there trouble in texas the name is bernard
the way she said she never would have thought she would have to go through this a if any woman ever think that like no one wake up thinking about getting an abortion it not an exciting thing or some form of birth control like i hate woman like the one here and personally have no sympathy for whats shes going through
well that suck thanks to everyone too stupid to vote correctly
so tragiccan we spot letting men decide what we do with our body please go vote
there is no lie like christian dogma there is no hypocrisy like christian truth there is no cruelty like christian compassion there is no hatred like christian love people get what they vote for election matter and they can kill
glad i live in california
300314 it no fun when the rabbit ha the gun yall are okay when other woman are affected by draconian law but when it your turn wan na act confused
they look like republcans i think itd be funny if she died from it
it so crazy i am proabortion for many reason this being one of them like how doe abortion affect these anti doe it affect you physically are you physically hurt by it doe if affect you mentally or emotionally it like when those people say if you dont like it stop watching if you dont like abortion stop searching it up watching video about it dont hang out or talk to people who have had or are going to have an abortion if it on something and you dont want to see it turn it off look away all baby know is the womb they dont know anything outside of the womb they havent experienced the outside world parent dont know what they actually look like since it a black white and gray ultrasound the baby most likely ha no idea what their parent look like so i see nothing wrong i just saw a video about a woman who had killed her 21 day old something baby on my youtube recommendation there wa a girl who killed her baby and buried it after prom these crime were before this roe v wade but imagine how it will increase after this roe v wade all because of these people that chose to vote for antiabortion not even looking deeper and realizing why it is needed just wait in 510 year the affect will be known and yes now it showing both side will have to face the affect of this ruling yes people killing there child wa bad before and itll still be bad now most likely with an increase baby will still be dying you havent changed much this time itll be baby that are outside they arent in the womb anymore it the real world
leopard ate her face you voted for this i hope youre happy
used to be if you were pregnant you were pregnant no ultrasound no abortion get what life give only the convenience of said preventative leaf people in their feeling of being wronged unjustified right and autonomy liberal and choice all modern term to turn something natural into a convention and then steered back to natural through the grief and unrighteousness of it all disclaimer my condolence to this family and others who have gone through traumatic pregnancy experience
men can still purchase viagra condom and vasectomy
cruel vicious barbaric and not christian
we is a miracle maybe your baby will survive and be ok
i wonder how many people who are against abortion have ever chose euthanasia for a pet animal
having an abortion is murder no matter what noone had the right to disregard a baby an unborn they have a right to live and yes even if they have health issue they are human being not to be disgarded like a piece of garbage if you dont want kid then prevent it from happening
there should be exception in the law for case like this
54 of woman having abortion used contraception during the month they became pregnant woman having 2 or more abortion are more than 2x a likely to be 30 or older and even after controlling for age almost 2x a likely to already have had a child like this woman here these woman also are more likely to be using highly effective hormonal birth control the pill injection implant the ring the data that the rightwingers use is from abortion peak in the 80 since then there ha been a steady decline in them make fully informed decision dont just rely on what a talking head is saying turn the tv off for a night and research both side thats what patriotism is about thats how to be a good citizen
this is a lie
yeah everyone say this is why the couple should only make the decisionumm they knew the risk of having a child there is no guarantee your child will be healthy and normal it a life not a car or object when are people going to realise this that you cant just desposeget rid of because you didnt like the order
if you think this is wrong you should not have kid
thats cruel to make her carry to term
she or any woman is welcome to come to oregon
i have an idea maybe we should just pay woman the respect of believing they know what is best for themselves and their family
honestly it is sad that they had to get to this point in life and have to carry a baby full term under those condition however i can not feel bad because i can only assume they voted yes to pas the anti abortion law and the whole time the information knowledge the empathy to see and learn a to why it so important to keep abortion legal all at the disposal of our mobil phone in our world in this day and age there are serial rapist predator foster home and adoption agency which are full to the brim with kid that are not wanted any more or parent cant afford medical care or food we see advertisement on the news to adopt child and yet we pas a law to stop more child who are coming into this world only to be given up removed raped or in this instance live to take a breath and then die nobody turn their attention to those kid and want to do something about no instead we a human being want to put our nose in somebody el business and think we have a right to pick for them
my friend ha a 6 year old boy with this he wasnt supposed to live past 1yr but god and what he can do
this comment section doe not pas the vibe check have some empathy instead of gloating over this family suffering
so did she have that baby already or not im confused also id love to adopt if they dont want the baby or did the baby not survive im just happy mom is alive and healthy sometimes the mom die too just tragic how these thing can end up happening to you and you end up losing the woman you love whoever voted for this should be ashamed and do what they can to reverse this ruling they should have been able to abort
not only no but hell no that isnt fair to the mother dad or baby
woman are under attack i cant believe weve allowed this to happen you can not force a woman to carry a fetus she doesnt want to carry for whatever reason the woman say is final and the only one that matter you can not legislate sex you can not force the bringing of child into the world we arent taking proper care of the one we already have the notion presented that there are lot of adoptive family just waiting is a complete lie and i know that for a fact there arent enough adoptive family for the poor baby who will be brought into this world with no one who will take them why cant people see that the purpose is to cripple woman and obtain surplus body to throw into war into prison that are now profitdriven to create an even bigger underclass that the upperclass will use for their own purpose this insane law is already causing and will cause horrible thing to happen this insane law will feed poverty feed the sex slave industry create more agony hunger and death dysfunction mental illness and further destabilize our country and the world there are too many people on the planet now we are outstripping the ability to feed everyone a it is no woman undergoes an abortion willydilly abortion is a sad but absolutely necessary part of conscious civilized existence if this law is going to continue just go ahead and put woman into chain and be honest about seeing them a property and chattel and nothing more than production cow abortion ha been legal for 50 year it became legal for a very good reason that history taught u young woman who arent fighting this attack on their very being their very life are too young to understand why legal safe abortion became law in the first place those who do not understand or heed history are doomed to repeat it wake up and vote to stop this insanity
im sorry for her but all she went through and still sound like she would vote prolife again it interesting to hear story from the woman who wantvoted for this
also wtf you dont have to go to mexico go to any other state like u alaska
god bless you all big hug hug hug
so you agreed with woman losing agency over their own body until your right were taken away huh foh
people shouldnt have sex if they dont want kid and if they get forced to then use a weapon to stop whoever the guy is
hmm maybe stop fucking with woman body it not your choice or opinion
it so fcked up what the government control in our life
come on doctor of america stand and fight for something did you sell your soul to religion and the corporation i know many woman doctor and nurse are trying to stand up are they the only one with the gut of course i know all this doesnt affect you men like it doe we woman your oath is first do no harm if you dont stand up for that you are not worthy to be called doctor
rightwingers believe selfishness if a virtue they pas these horrific law supported by awful people who simply dont care about the impact because they dont think it will impact them these people are despicable
clickbait it not a nonviable pregnancy sometimes the doctor are wrong like when they said the baby had down syndrome they are wrong and the baby come out normal so you just killed someone for no reason killing someone with disability isnt fair to them and they are saying the baby might not live beyond 1 year but they dont know
no man ha the right to tell any woman what they can or can not do with their body these men are disgusting
people want to remove birth control and place hardship on woman for getting pregnant but ignore the guy who are so eager not to wear a condom because his private is too big or it doesnt feel right or whatever b these guy come up with
abortion is healthcare calling it birth control indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of why people choose should be able to choose to get it
well it a conudrum but i personally will keep you in my thought and prayer im so sorrythis is beyond stupid and who is going to care for him for a year if he actually life im a christian but i also still have common sense and im a nurse and i had an abortion lon ago because i am rh negative and i didnt know it and got pregnant and didnt know it and i wa testing negative but i wa pregnant with an rh positive fetus and i w having a severe allergic reaction to the fetus crazy a that sound any how i had an awful experience but i am alive
i dont know a single woman using abortion a birth control wtaf
be careful when you vote against your own best interest
so sad condolence to them it so heartbreaking to have a sick little one in utero especially with this outcome
texas should be all liable for funeral cost for this baby
she want to blame someone and i cant blame her however even when dc were not frowned upon doctor still had the mother deliver the stillborn infant through the last 3 decade when abortion wa funded through planned parenthood and clinic in every city abortion ha become birth control
this is a tragedy once again politician have no business in reproduction god bless you and your family im so sorry
election have consequence folksyou wanted ityou got it
the echo of this trauma will forever affect the surviving daughter too please dont forget her need she see her mom belly grow she hears people publicly ask when are you dueis it a boy or girl her friend at school have new sibling coming home she sadly wont the unnecessary forced trauma this will have on her is unconscionable the shrink clergy etc dont have adequate answer for her ive asked im navigating this same loss with a 4 year old too dont underestimate her profound pain disappointment my deepest condolence for yall
thanks for the explanation
so called christian and other religious type are the most ignorant people when it come to the human body the only reason they know where their heart is is because it beat and they have no clue a to how it work just that it beat they are dangerous and are killing woman with their selfish ignorance try talking to one about health and the body you will be talking to dumb and dumber woman of america we must fight this evil for our freedom just like the brave lady of iran who are being slaughtered by a government who is trying to keep them a sex slave
this ban is simply about control and harm to woman body and mind
texas republican death cult
uggghh the mental health of it all
better pick a better governor next time
i live in texas and chose to terminate my first pregnancy last year for medical reason it wa the hardest and most heart breaking experience ive ever gone through and texas abortion law add insult to injury ive always been pro choice but i never thought id personally be in a situation where i would have to choose you truly dont know what it like until youre there
this is what they voted for dont cry now
atp i feel like this is a lesson in life for them hopefully they will gain some sort of empathy for all woman including the one their daughter will be
where do they draw the line with this though if your unborn child wa diagnosed to have down syndrome it just ok to kill it because you dont want it to have a disability it a slippery slope
the democrat love killing baby
wellif you didnt have the ultra sound you would have never knownand trust me she will survive iwe have and we have 2 and you will survive if you choose too haveing a child with special need isnt the end all to your life unless that is what you choose yep we got what yall wanted in texas now roll with your vote
this is a valid reason to abort a baby he gon na be born without brain and that will affect the life of the family it better they abort him than they bring him to the world to suffer abortion wa banned because of woke woman who started aborting baby for no reason
voting matter tired of saying it over and over yet majority voted for this a man who force to carry even in case or rape and incest bunch of weirdo over here for sure
pro choice miserable disgusting men making poor decision based on hate
guy you vote for the government so you got now whay you voted for
maga evangelicals are not prolife pro child nor pro family their one concern is power to force their dogma onto the rest of america
easy to solvemove out of texas
and this is exactly why abortion should be legal everywhere
in america everyone ha right that is except woman
im personally not for it being a way of birth control but there are some instance where i deem that it is necessary i bet she actively fought against abortion now she deems it necessary im sorry but it too late to cry about it now or have the rule specifically altered just for you how convenient that it only a problem when it a problem for you
why didnt she just go to planned parenthood which is government funded healthcare for woman
good maybe she shouldve kept her leg closed
daddy is sad and mad i am too this is obscene eclampsia is so deadly for her woman are human being even in the bible belt the politician dont believe this is right they just want some red meat to feed their mad dog base i watched one of my dearest friend gamble with her life and get eclampsia if we didnt live right near a hospital she would be dead privacy mean privacy woman have always died in childbirth but we live in a modern world why torture woman ive never met a person who used abortion a birth control they use it because of all the circumstance life brings including the economy stupid
criminal they want to wait for herself to suffer medical problem i can not thanks for bravely telling this personal journey it really show the heartbreak quiet desperation this is shocking medical professional should sack up end this tragedy with some medical dignity for them this should be lawsuit precedence they should get something monetary at least in this ordeal
i am pro choice what happens if a person come up and ask to touch your belly do you tell them the baby ha died and because of the abortion ban judging and you have someone telling you what to do people should get fact straight people do not have abortion for birth control
if youre a female still capable of getting pregnant living in texas you need to be planning an exit plan otherwise this could very easily be your future or worse
this is horriblethe state they live in had no right forcing them to do what they want the decision should be up to the parent
the devil owns texas
vote them out take back your right
can someone tell me why she cant travel to a state where abortion is legal
when are we going to ban viagra need to happen asap
it is still a baby i could never purposefully take my baby life
anyone else notice the baby boomer lawmaker want america back to the way it wa when they were kid
these lawmaker are a bunch of hypocrite
i dont agree with abortion at all but i do believe that there should be special term apply to certain case this is sad
thats horrific it abuse and torture to the woman she could have died
if i had to choose a word to describe this ungrateful so someone who ha been actively trying finally conceives then would rather choose to terminate that living gift because of his imperfection and possible short life span than to appreciate and cherish his life no matter the length and disability
unacceptable our woman deserve better
this crap is so ridiculous i can not believe that our government is interfering with our most personal life choice it is nothing short of barbaric and frightening a hell and dont give me your psycho babble bullshit about the bible or what you believe is morally wrong all that show is how truly ignorant you are and have no concept of what people deal with in our personal life
this is a horrible thing to go through however i hope her hypocrisy is not lost on viewer she refuse to use the word abortion calling it a procedure and go on to say she doesnt believe it a suitable method for birth control now that she requires an abortion for her own medical emergency she find validity in it use she and her husband may also have voted for the very people that contributed to an abortion ban in her home state i dont feel sympathy or empathy towards her they are also showing their privilege in being able to travel to different state to seek out expensive abortion unfortunately those state also have their own conservative led abortion ban in place will we see these two at a prochoice rally now that they are forced to carry a nonviable fetus to term probably not
she literally said it shouldnt be used a a form of birth control because realistically no it shouldnt she did however say that in medical instance she support it she isnt facing the consequence of her own action and you cant assume how this woman voted if you asked me if i 100 support abortion id say not entirely but i damn sure did not vote for the politician who took away a woman right to choose regardless of my opinion on elective abortion it still every woman right to make the choice for her body stop attacking this woman who going through something traumatic that most of yall have never experienced it sick
it unfortunate that woman used abortion a birth control for child in utero and even partial birth that had no defect forcing state to take such drastic measure to protect child
pro choice is the right of choice freedom of choice not pro murder not pro death it pro choice this is a literal restriction onto woman only that alone is an issue
lady you got what you voted for and personally i hope your baby survives and becomes the biggest burden to you and your husband
you can sign paper and have someone taking off life support
heartbreaking for anyone wanting a child to suffer a loss of one with the current law they could have turned a devastating situation into joy for many others youre in dallas there is husband and wife that have had two pregnancy with a similar genetic defect before the abortion band went in to affect they still chose to take the baby to term because they donated all the viable organ to other baby who needed them their first child saved 12 infant life and improved the quality of life for 30 more and when they got pregnant again the same thing and they did the same thing every year for mother day they get so many flower and card from not just the people whose kid are alive today because of them but from all over the city all over the state i dont know what they did with their child but if they were to have done that they would have zero cost in hospital bill
sue the state for emotional damage
so the solution is kill the baby so it doesnt die
there is no danger to her life but shes complaining that she will have a baby that will die young and she wish she could just kill it right now
leave it to government to control woman body and choice they must be proud of themselves
this isnt dangerous for the mother so unless it is a perfect child you dont want to birth it let stop being selfish and start caring for child of all ability if it had down syndrome would she be asking the same
why would you want to murder your baby at 23 week anyways and just carry your baby to term and let him or her go the way they are supposed to
vote blueesp this family living in that wheelchairmonster greg abbott someone need to put him on a hill and gravity do it thing texas is a waste of space they have that possom facedidiot ted cruz but i live in florida where our governor is trash too and sadly my state is full of rural uneducated florida men or boomer from place like the village all are a bunch of fox news watching homophobic racist insurrectionist loving cruel karen this poor lady texas will always be a red state tho too many rural bible thumping cowboy who hate immigrant no matter how many people die from a failing utility gridthey will still vote slug like cruz and abbot in until we all vote out every single republican that ban book ban abortion make up ridiculous law to hurt gay and drag queen and shipping immigrant all over there are thing that can be done on these issue but both side keep them a hot button issue bc they need vote every cycle they dont want u working on term limit and forcing them to stop taking lobbyist pay offs it all a distraction get mad and vote blue the lesser of two evil at least democrat want weed legalized look at what it did for colorado california nevada instead of being a welfare state place like kentucky could leave coal mining in the past where it belongs im sick of the dumbasseslike fucker carlson alex mtg matt gaetz lauren bobertall are huge turd with nothing valuable to add to any conversation
i bet they voted against abortion but now it affect them so it a problem typical
i will always stand by a woman right to choose keep in mind it mostly male governor who banned abortion care in their state woman should be making these law
time to crack down down dirty government make dirty law
wow way to make her trauma worse didnt think losing a baby could get worse but the legal system really just said hold my beer
terrible occurrence but you can go elsewhere
all of these politician have gotten out of hand it time for this all to stop and make a change going forward not backwards
oh my sorry hun i cant imagine what you are going thrupraying for you n your family
sue the state of tx for assault this is a crime against humanity
from what i am getting from her comment about it not being a form a of birth control the definitely voted to pas the law and put those in place who passed the law i am sorry that they are going through this but not taking time to think about who and what you are voting for and how it could possibly affect your future is insane i will keep them in my prayer and hopefully the next time this law come or up the people in place to make the law are wanting reelection they think twice about it
unds like she voted for this tho
there nothing wrong with prochoice dont let this godless society tell you otherwise have faith
i think if her health is in danger i can understand it but if not this still is a life
it break my heart to hear parent talking about the child they conceived in such sterile term and the word youre looking for is abortion dont hide from the gruesome reality of what it actually is and what happens to a developing baby the child is still worthy to be loved no matter how short the life may be is it difficult yes but the value and principle of life is valuable is absolute not just when it get hard
i had s similar situation i wa 20 week along i had perinatal counciling and requested a csection and thankfully my insurance approved it and i wa given a hysterotomy my baby wa born and she died outside of my womb but she passed humanly and i didnt have to go through the emotional grief of continuing in a pregnancy to full term
i feel for them because i have a friend who ha gone through 3 miscarriage despite her and her husband really wanting to have child however the lack of awareness is stunning shes making judgment call on people who receive healthcare when she think it used a birth control yet shes upset that provider are making the same judgment call on her not having the choice to receive necessary healthcare is literally what they voted for it only a problem now that they are personally affected
shes not forced she can drive to another state
terribly sad for the family terribly sad about the circumstance but this is what happens when you vote for republican ted cruz greg abbott and the rest of the republican are responsible for this dilemma they decided that woman are second class citizen and voted to strip them of the right to make medical decision about their own body they disregard your health what kind of impact this will have on your family and the financial cost that this will entail a well will ted cruz be on the hook for the delivery and any complication will greg abbott be on the hook for the child funeral forcedbirthing is reproductive slavery made legal im worried about another thing since this family went public will they come home to find a warrant for their arrest for seeking an abortion too
she definitely alluded to being prolife later on in the video i have empathy for her awful situation but doe she and her ilk honestly believe prochoice woman want to intentionally kill baby the reality is not all fetus will become healthy baby and abortion is the only option to save the mother i hate these selfish asshole who have no compassion until it happens to them yet theyll still vote republican because they believe the lie that theyre better economically small government and to own the libs democrat are awful a well so any attempt at a what aboutism is moot
1 in a million mom and million baby saved from death and being cut in piece in their mother womb
texas the most back assward people in the nation
republican talk nonstop about spending to much money le government stay out of people life and here are the fruit of their labor a family that will suffer with a non viable pregnancy forced to carry to term if this child life 1 year the parent will have to apply for medicaid to keep him alive or allow nature to take it course thus prolonging this family suffering it just doesnt make sense stay out of these people life at their most emotional important difficult time in their life
disgusting pro lifer look what woman have to go through bc oh save the babiesyeah how about go adopt child in foster care and save them so sorry for youprayers
love the baby anyway we adopted a baby with this condition and he only lived for a couple month but in those month he wa loved and cherished and taken cared of rip baby matt pat
if texas want to make the decision for people they should pay the cost of pregnancy and raising the child including for mother that must stay home to take care of those child medical food rent childcare if they are the one who think they need to make the decision for others and if the mother life is lost they should pay maybe 5million to the survivor
this ha gotten so out of control supreme court ha made this chaos happen
texas law doe not force woman to carry a nonviable fetus physician ignorance or fostering an agenda stop the lie and fear mongering
now this baby is gon na die if t doe grow and leave the womb or itll never become anything and im all for woman right and we should be able to control our own body but at the same time woman let get smarter stop having sex without condom and thinking birth control is gon na help you stop having sex without condom cause the guy doesnt want to wear it or you dont want to wear it and look for hole and get the right size if it too big for him the cum will slip down and into you we shouldnt need abortion you should be careful when having sex unprotected and protected even if you two have known eachother two year now no keep that condom on you didnt want any kid but youre letting him cum in you come on now get smarter woman
i never thought leopard would eat my face sob woman who voted for the leopard eating people face party
this is so very unfair maybe we need to look at men responsibility and men birth control and what about that little blue pill can you imagine the outrage if that wa taken away it is despicable that woman are treated so inferior thing would be alot different if this were happening to men they would be screaming like little girl
this is so stupid
abortion are free in california
this is not pro life
hop on a plane goto a safe abortion state done
this is why nobody like texas
this is what happens when you vote against woman and need the service you voted against karma
may they enjoy their child a long a they can
but essentially what theyre fighting for is birth control your either stupid or havent been in the business of politics long enough to realize it sad that this wonderful fam went through that sad that abc took it upon themselves to find this one in a million couple to make an example from when every 45 minute a baby dy from abortion without any underlying condition good job nation wide medium
she shouldve been more careful thats on heror no sex if you dont want kid
sad you continue to vote for those that place these law
if the human body will expell the fetus safely in it ownthen there is no need to interfere if abortion are not necessary to preserve life then they should not be utilized condolence to this family however these scenario will not be used to justify abortion
yes instead of injecting euthanasia drug into the baby heart which ha been banned for being too inhumane for dog and cat in most state and then tear the baby limb from limb texas said to allow the baby to pas naturally on hospice with love and care pro abort are truly the sickest people on the planet
i like how she still cant empathize with other woman situation when she say shes not for it being used a form of birth control abortion for me but not for thee
this is why sometimes abortion is needed unfortunately nature is not perfect alot can go wrong and sometimes it is sever like for example any year ago a good friend wa expecting her first she wanted the child and wa overjoyed kept healthy did everything right for her pregnancy but in the second trimester an ultrasound showed that some of the baby internal organ where developing outside the body heart lung and some of the gi track the baby wa alive but there wa very little chance of the child survival when born she had to make the heartbreaking decision of getting an abortion in the best decision for her baby there wa no ryme nor reason for the cause of the sever deformity from what her doctor told her simple explanation wa these thing happen thing can go wrong unfortunately nature is not perfect and can be cruel a we all know it wa no one fault nor no one to blame it just these thing happen and it is what it is yea medical technology had came a long way especially with reproductive medicine but there is a limit
so the baby is suffering just because she cant do anything about it the law is letting this innocent suffer until it born
go to jesus and ask him to heal your child a god to make the child whole and healthy stop thinking to terminate only god know the future pray to save the child god can change anything even this
i can not believe america low dont comply with basic human right established a century ago this is insane the more restricting the low and the society norm towards woman the fewer baby are born how long is it going to take to learn this lesson
the republican party sure is committing a lot evil in the name of jesus religious extremist always do not only do you have worry about thing like this now but if your baby survives you have to worry about what if they turn out to be gay or trans republican are writing law that could have them taken away by the state placed in to foster care and you charged with child abuse republican are writing law about how they can and cant dress if a man dress to feminine in tennessee it a crime now vote blue and save freedom and democracy
thumb down for 15 second ad why you could do 1 5 second ad
this is such a lie complete and total propaganda just like roe v wade wa but what else can you expect from abc
abortion is the voluntary termination of a healthy viable fetus should absolutely be illegal she didnt need an abortion she needed medical intervention to terminate a nonviable pregnancy it pretty simple
death unfortunately occurs either way it is devastating for the family specifically the mother to have to go through this im so sorry i hope this baby life a beautiful life however long he is alive and brings joy that surpasses this great pain nobody should have to lose their child whether it be in utero or after birth it not fair
blessed be the fruit republican
leave it to god maybe the baby will be ok
and some wonder why many people dont take church seriously anymore
254 im personally not for abortion being used a a birth control but there are certain instance where i deem it a necessary so you are pro choice no one is proabortion we are pro letting people make their own medical decision also where you deem a necessary will every woman need to run their abortion by you to determine if their reasoning match your moral compass never would i imagine wed be going through this conservative love making rule for other people and have no concept of empathy until the rule apply to them and suddenly they demand an exception
the fact that you people dont get this this is nature we should not be interfering with nature anyway look at our world because weve interfere with nature i feel really bad for those couple i do but let get real about this this s happens people get pregnant in their baby come out fup it nature god just nature basic nature fit kalmanovich ever phoenix chicken come out weird he not up to u to decide which one of these creature come out of whatever grayson is worthy of life or not or chance are you serious
the only comment ill make is that i hope her ob counsel on folic acid and it role in prevention of neural tube defect not saying she wa ever deficient or that lack of folate wa the cause im just saying she need to be on it now during childbearing year and continue it religiously during any future pregnancy she also ideally should let her body recover from this trauma before trying again this is not only physically taxing for her but the emotional trauma affect both of them my cousin baby girl lived for about 2 hour with what used to be called water head not a nice way to say it but thats how many understand what it is she had no skull only a fluid capsule with her brain inside the doctor immediately put her on a strict daily dose of 800mcg of folic acid and she went on to have a strong healthy little boy who is now a u marine
shes no victim dont want kid close your leg be a responsible adult not a baby killer so texas
u people r sick stop killing child
what about is abortion wasnt an option because backintheday didnt have that option today major planet your baby wa supposed to be born no matter what maybe that isnt your choice maybe thats god choice and youre wrong in this you really are youre trying to tell me youre f addicted to something because you couldnt kill your baby are you serious right now stop it sometimes baby are born again we dont get to just kill whatever it is if we dont feel comfortable with you understand that get real
this is so sad that this family ha no control over their own life and life of their wellbeing and family the family is suffering and the unborn child is going to suffer no one can put themselves mentally in this family shoe thats why people are not commenting more people need to educate themselves this is a perfect example of why people would put their life in danger to have an illegal abortion people must stop being afraid to speak up
you can always just shove a coat hanger in there
there are herb that will cause the uterus to contract angelica root or yarrow are two woman have taken care naturally and need to continue to do so i wish for peace to return to these people this is very tragic
well maybe this lady should have gone to the state next to her and got her abortion because it did not need to be publicized and every need to be talked im so sorry but the fact that you decided to be a victim all on your own that really is on you cuz you could have gone to another state fortune is not completely legal in the united state this is a big fat lie
this is fucked up and inhumae
the year is 2023 and a young country like south africa which wa democratic only in 1994 ha more law that protect woman abortion and the lgbtqi compared to a country like america which ha been democratic for more than 100 year that is scary i just stumbled upon this post and i am feeling really sad for kylie i believe that a country is not democratic if it is abusing woman especially in this way the fact that young country are progressing in making sure that they properly protect all it citizen and america is heading backwards is sad
america must wake up see the problem in my opinion there will be depression from the mother and possible suicide rate going up which i fear bring abortion back
abortion should be illegal to use a a birth control method not when it medically necessary or from rape
great job abbott rot in hell
welp you made america great again i truely feel when you let religion govern law you start to fall backwards a a nation history show it
men who support abortion ban are disappointing but woman who support abortion ban are traitor continue to vote for anti abortion law and candidate and you will suffer the consequence along with the rest of u woman are people we have every right to defend our body even if it mean killing another person to do it
isnt there a point where it nonger considered an abortion like if there is a known health risk to mother baby or both when is it considered medical for the sake of your life
watch it will come to a point that woman wont be allowed to have ultrasound so that non of these health concern are found until to late so sad to see
it is a medical procedure regardless of the reason it is tragic that anyone should have to terminate a pregnancy but life is full of reality it should be available to anyone who come to the wellinformed decision that this is the best option with no judgement
i super hope the bill get reverse because damn the people who make law in america just show the world how a developed country actually can turn into a caveman world it sad she should have the choice if abortion banned due to faith than why stop there let banned plastic surgery prsh let hope for a change
this is what our great america ha turn into no hope no help and no compassion for woman and child
what is the no 1 cause of death of pregnant woman murder by their baby daddy boyfriend husband or ex that alone is justification for legal abortion
isnt it amazing how quickly people change their stance on issue the second they are personally affected
how could they put those parent through such tragedy they know the baby wont survive but theyre making her carry it anyway that ha got to be emotionally torturous
we need to come to a balance no 9 month abortion of healthy baby no killing at 20 week they can feel the pain of dissection or acid bath a child with no chance if every test ha been repeatably performed and sensory receptor to detect pain are not in place do to lack of brain function it seems cruel to both mother and child
you live in texas you should have known that this would happen i did
wt actually f
got ta love texas
travel a little farther to ca it would be no cost
that heart breaking
why is this called nonviable describe viable
this country is truly unbelievable america the great it is not
pet or animal can be put to sleep tho
we dont need the music playing with something so horrible and tragic
so she wa pro life until she needed an abortion
in the beginning abortion wa intended for such circumstance then they wanted more to the point that the child is fully developed and started using it like birth control the beast took over and started harvesting and making big money while society is left with broken woman whose only right wa murder of off spring
if it abc news then you better fact check store bought liberal medium
this story is absurd who is anybody to tell her what she can do make me sick god bless her i cant imagine what it mustve been like for her it absolutely ridiculous poor thing
im not sure why anyone would want to live in that god awful state
move girl move away and then come back
you got served what you ordered eat it
republican took away healthcare from woman no big deal right woman voting right are next woman are second class citizen once again biden 2024
this father is teary eyed and emotional you just know before he wa in this situation he wa down at the watering hole yuking it with his good old boy buddy about owning the libs
why did this couple not come to california or even looked into coming to california for what they needed for there are plenty of obgyns here that would be very accomidating to what this couple need and besides california is a lot closer to texas than new mexico
this is just sickening and one instance when abortion can be necessary and lifesaving these rigid law are doing far more harm than good
many doctor told me my daughter wa not ok that she would not make it to full term she wa perfect born 8 lb 9 take care i hope for the best for everyone
my former girlfriend and her daughter are antiabortion and yet they firmly believe it necessary on occasion like this theyre against abortion yet they are far more rational than the religiously conservative lawmaker who are dragging this country into another dark age
absolutely disgusting having no say over your own body allowing more suffering than needed the mother and baby were both at more at risk continuing ridiculous
in yet the no abortion law wa passed
add another 10000 on top of that because someone just filed for the bounty on you going out of state for an abortion
anyone that vote republican is one of two type of people that might hop back and forth personality 1 vote to make money 2 have no idea what they want or talk about thats it it sad that they still will bite the same way the next election cycle
but she is alive to tell about this so it did not threaten her life to have a baby in this condition which normally would produce a stillborn what is the difference between an abortion and a stillborn she just wanted control over the extraction it actually may have been better for her health to see all the hormone through such a progesterone estrogen and prolactin to encourage easier recovery from the loss the body need those hormone to balance and promote healing after a pregnancy this isnt burger king where you can order what you want without considering the repercussion are they saying that they know more than medical professional or that abortion should be like a product and they can have it whenever they want for a reason they are more worried about than professional medical provider people need to learn their anxiety doe not equal medical knowledge and just because they are consumer of medical care doe not make the whole industry of medicine like a store where idiot can dictate their medical care without exhibiting medical need they definitely should move out of texas though there are plenty of state that align with their expectation
you blame the woman who kill baby for fun
what a sham american freedom is when woman have to endure these kind of law there are no word
it doesnt affect you until it enters your life easy to vote for consequence but often harder to live with them
we need people like them to put their vote where their best interest is i am currently living in tx i cant wait to get the fvck out
this is just so wrong sending prayer for this family
one of those thing people dont care about until it happens to them smh
should be a campaign ad for voting red
pro life nah it profit abortion would cost them money they would make from medical bill cost of raising unwanted child cost of funeral for dead mother forced to carry dangerous pregnancy every unwanted baby born is just another number in the game of profit and senseless greed all the religion and pro life b is a facade
absolutely horrible this lady had to endure this make me so mad
well this is what you guy voted for to have republican leader that have a god complex and believe that they are right and nothing else matter
they need to bring back roe v wade
oh america what a disgusting fuckhole
no one us abortion a birth control im pretty annoyed that a woman who ha had to suffer only now understands that abortion is healthcare and doesnt belong in the hand of legislator
well i guess it what jesus would want and no one is more in tune with what jesus would do than the entire gop
this is why if youre against abortion you should not have an abortion everyone else should be allowed to for whatever reason
this is why we are a secular nation by design religious rule is evil
it is not only inhumane it is also absolute madness i would love to have been born in a state like texas for so many reason but these abortion ban are going to cause so many problem for woman
wheres the gofundme for this lady this is a nightmare
im sorry this is happening to her but did her vote put her in this spot people need to stop saying or implying that woman have used abortion a their birth control method stop repeating that lie
if shes against abortion did she celebrate the overturning of roe v wade if she did suck it up buttercup this is what you asked for
this is a tough situation brave of them to share this i feel for this couple especially the woman at the same nonviable seems inaccurate because the baby can carry to term and be born it that the baby ha a terminal diagnosis
what the world
what would you do if we didnt have ultrasound technology be thankful for your son and the short time you will get to spend with him he is part of your life journey
the doctor said most of these child dont live passed a year why wouldnt anyone want to be able to spend a much or little time a they possibly could with their child letting it know how much they were loved instead of just killing them because they couldnt handle having such a small amount of time with abortion is cruel and selfish and most of all murder and i dont care who get mad or what they say i have a right to my belief just like everyone else doe
so sad the pain this couple ha to endure abortion is a human right
this is what happens when one doesnt think in principle banning or creating absurd restriction on abortion creates situation like this no one ever think it can happen to them what if she develops sepsis this is why i changed my mind about moving to texas
my condolence to the family but let remember we have great doctor out there who can help
this is why abortion should really only be used in case of rape incest and emergency health complication with the mother and baby
so they voted prolife because they wanted control over other woman body and never expected it to actually have an affect on them sound like karma to me
realistically if someone did actually try using it for birth control every time they got pregnant itd probably be very stressful for the body i dont get how some people legit believe woman using it a just straight up birth control
give woman power over their body the science is there the preventability is there let them make a choice
what a world we live in now they cant differentiate between necessary and convenience shame on the elite they will be judged one day and i look forward to that day a malformities that should never exist like 1 in 40 child born with autism climb from 1 in 10000 30 year ago to 1 in 2 child being born with autism in a little a 5 year their claim not mine because of the toxic level of chemicles in our food and world because of allowing thisnow they decide to let a brainlesss child be carried to full term it just like them this is an atrocitie im so sorry for this family i pray they are rest assured that their child will be in heaven and one day they will get to be with them in all the beauty and perfection and wholeness that god created that baby with had our fda and epa not been corrupted prayer sent for this family i am so very very sorry you have to go through this
i dont get how texas pride themselves on freedom yet their law for woman are stuck in the past youre not free until it applies to u all
3 year later mother forced to sell her body due to republican fighting against a livable minimum wage and government program republican not our problemour motto is from conception till birth after that youre on your own honey
truly appalling all the state enforcing this should be responsible for all medical bill and therapy a a result
that is a 2 heart breaking event in oneone is nature that is heart breaking for them enough the other one is because the religious dumb f ass in tx
this law is wrong so wild that it is one look at u all people everywhere there are too many then a family like this is being torn up over some old man idea about making money and making baby
this is horrible im wishing your family well
what third world country do they live in
the sad thing though about texas is they have crappy insurance when it also come to child birthing a well prolife with crappy insurance
so cool that the government is getting involved in woman health decision
good now stp being religioius or atleast forcing in to others since when an uborn baby life is more important than the mom lmao even if it wa already a baby and not a fetus thats crazy
i hold the same belief a this woman although i do not consider this procedure to be a replacement for birth control it should be available in medical situation such a this or other serious issue not to mention rape incest minor or medical condition for the woman that may not fall under the purview of this law it insane that this family will be forced to go through this entire pregnancy only for the baby to not make it long the additional pain this family is experiencing ha only begun and it heartbreaking
btw so few woman use abortion a birth control it ridiculous to punish everyone when clearly there are good reason for taking that step in the vast majority of case
it always different when it happens to you
the insanity going on in the u is off the chain so a woman could die from disease due to a decaying fetus but thats ok in fl a bill is up that young girl can not even talk about period what the hell is going on please vote get these zelots out and let a woman and her dr make that medical choice not the gov or church
mistake 1 living in texas
conservative are a menace to society
blessed be the fruit
these republican are not thinking of the grief of the parent or the death or dismemberment of the mother and how that affect her living child or partner or extended family and friend it really look a if they want to just punish woman for having female reproductive system we also live in a cruel misogynistic state now and i hope my daughter is able to move to a safe country one day many cant
gratitude and respect to this couple for their courage to share their story i support you and thank you im so deeply sorry you have to go through this
it honestly wouldnt surprise me if these very same people voted for the lawmaker to get into office
the irony of her situation yikes
absolutely ridiculous come on america we can do better
the state of texas should have to pay all expense for that kid up until it 18th bday
please vote all woman deserve so much better and the right to choose for our own body it doe not belong in the hand of antiquated belief
this is bullshit they try to find a person to fit their agenda and then they try to do a medium blitze this is not what texas need to be broadcasting what they need to be broadcasting is the border issue and the 100 thousand plus people dead last year because of it where are they on the 100 thousand life they caused to be poisoned answer that and then we will think about other thing
this is what happens when crusty old men run the country
they got what they voted for
hearing them both speak on this is heartbreaking
so whose life are they protecting now this people who decide how everyone should choose are ridiculous ignorant this should be an exception
texas and the u have regressed to the stone age and it is beyond shameful and against woman right and health
oh sorry you cant murder your special need baby also nonviable with what sound more like inconvenient than non viable
so this is what happens when crusty old men run the country lol
when the government start micromanagement of healthcare decision it never go well talk about extreme restriction of freedom and dictatorship type behavior telling woman they must carry unviable fetus to full term and risk their life to deliver a baby much larger than necessary who ha 0 chance at survival sick evil wicked politician pretending theyre a party of freedom while committing human right atrocity against the american people like this
she got what she voted for dont see the problem here ohh she want access to abortion just not other woman
i wa just looking at the background the whole time like damn thats a big fan a soon a she hit u with how she belief i have no empathy for them separate church from state and whatever belief you have
this is why people are mad at all the ignorance surrounding this issue abortion are not just for people who dont want to be pregnant themoreyouknow
we have traveled back in time to a very dark place
i feel bad for them
not a form of birth control so what it suck because it you you either support the right to choose or you dont
im very sorry for these parent i cant imagine what they must be dealing with
texas is all in on treason and religiousdomestic terrorism just like all maga traitor
voter of the leopard eating face party complains that leopard started eating their face
why cant she travel out of texas for an abortion
horrible situation we need to change the people in supreme court
but we keep electing the same governor how do we expect thing to get better if we dont vote him out
shes terrified because he baby is going to be born without a proper brain no im seriously asking because i wa looking for the health reason that put her life in danger all im hearing is they dont want to have a handicap child right or am i missing something
hate to say it but they probably voted right
when will these woman learn to keep their leg closed she better not get an abortion
and what is scary these politician take care of themselves in these situation it never been about baby it a political flex
usa this is not the freedom you boast about
i bet if it were a lawmaker wife it would be diffeeent
there are not word in my vocabulary to describe the vile emotion i have for these evil monstrous antiabortionists
well this is really sad and they are doing everything i would have done however it wa clear that voted republican and she said never in a million year did she think this would happen to her and she is against using abortion a a birth control you voted for this we tried to warn you this is what happens when you vote against your own interest anyway we are all in the same boat now saddle up cupcake because this is a going to be a bumpy ride
no one care when it wa the black woman in no recently but maybe this white woman will bring more awareness
going to new mexico for an abortion is crazy scary i get it im glad she said about not using it for birth control
this is what happens when a conservative supreme court change law that are not broken this woman passed judgment in this interview that she only agreed in this procedure for her circumstance that is why she is in this predicament because her lawmaker banned all procedure for all circumstance
she is so stupid for going on camera it so pathetic our people are so desperate for attention and social medium fame she could have easily just went to another state and got it done but now the whole world know shes pregnant stupid
we all know the state will not be providing for 24 hr care to take care of the child either
bullshit bunch of democrat b
just because a doctor say one thing doesnt mean that it will end up that way my son ha a heart condition he should have died from yet here he is should i have killed my baby just because of his heart condition
if you want to put out your agenda about abortion maybe the law is not it it so sad yall gon na see a lot of dead baby in the trash dumpster because of this law
merica is such a sick country
i would be so pissed if i had to have a kid i didnt want especially if it had developmental issue
i can tell by how she described a couple of thing that they are pro life this is exactly what they voted for they are only pro choice when it need to benefit them
she said there are certain instance where i deem abortion are necessary thats the thing it not up for you to deem every single woman should make that decision for themselves it should not be based on what someone else think they should do with their body this is why that ban is so dangerous ppl who probably would consider themselves pro life are now realizing that this ban could and will negatively affect them and the woman they love
give your baby up for adoption someone will love him until he pass away
because prolife craziness ha overcome any logic or science
the law is only for the corrupt and to help only the irish and government f the people
poor guy he taking it a lot harder than his wife it different when youre the one going through it than when your loved one is and youre powerless to help them
i 100 guarantee she helped vote the idiot into office that did this to her let keep it real it white folk that keep voting in evil so dont cry now
this is heartbreaking
texas is so toxic im surprised that state doesnt implode
my niece had her baby full term this beautiful baby wa born still born who had the same problem she wa happy she carried her baby knowing what is happening the child will die why wont people let them do it naturally not yanking them piece by piece out of womb what more is more loving
conservative texan abortion is murder it should be completely illegal also conservative texan oh look another school shooting in our stats let see how good this one wa oh awesome 21 people died and 19 of them were kid let go bruh i love this entertainment
thanks a lot trump
give him a fighting chanceso he life only a yearyou let him live you gave him life for a little while so torture him in the womb because he gon na be inconvenient to you for maybe a year i just dont understand
isnt the point of choice is to use your own discretion on if it necessary to you and the life you want to live obviously there are woman who will abuse this system and use it a a form of birth control but you better believe i would prefer that over a woman who is either too lazy not financially capable or not educated enough to use birth control to one day have the child due to an abortion ban who will abuse the child she did not want in the first place we have so many child who are born into family that do not want them who are being tortured and killed a is why make that a potentially bigger number because abortion doesnt feel necessary in your own life narcissism at it finest not everyone ha the life you do why choice is important
this is definitely a human and civil right violation
the catholic church pushed this agenda
you can go to another state that allows abortion there are option
stupid republican doings
this is why we need to think critically before we take drastic step without thought about the consequence
this is so cruel im sorry they had to go through this
god will be done
nevermind the 2 trail derailment the nuclear leak and u being on the brink of a world war 3
sound like their position and vote have come back to bite them bet they thought lack of female bodily autonomy would never be an issue for them
this is no longer a free country for woman these law arent about the right to life they are all about controlling woman and trying to put u back in our place like in the andy griffith day it is disgusting how far we have fallen in this nation and how republican are constantly stripping away our freedom to force everyone to fit in their cookie cutter box
that is so horrible caster oil and certain root are going to be making a huge come back
have faith in god will
if your wife sleep with another man will you keep the god giving child if your husband impregnated your best friend should he keep the god giving child abortion is murder remember that you people are fornicator yet tell lgbt people to live celibate life because the lord dislike it yet you same people sleep around with your friend from college and high school gay people can not kiss and hold hand because it is immoral yet the pastor daughter have abortion in secret to preserve that good reputation you people vote to ban gay marriage yet you sleep around committing adultery people are anti gay yet find way to justify abortion i dont want my boy to see 2 grown men kissing yet she ha had 2 abortion lol
my heart ache for this family i wa reading about this condition just the other day a mom expecting ivf twin she didnt have a selective termination because of the risk to the healthy baby and because she wa led to believe the affected child would die he lived 8 month never left hospital and experienced a tremendous amount of pain abortion is healthcare
so is she going to have to carry full term and give vaginal birth or c section to a already dead baby thats disgusting
this is the problem with conservative people they get fed through fox fake news that people use abortion a birth control too bad that for smallminded people it take an issue like abortion to hit you directly to inform yourself and look outside the box tge world is not just black or white
when passing law i feel they should add in special circumstance like these
republican are traitor
this is a horrible situation texas is wrong for banning abortion and it also wrong to abort after the 20th week first trimester abortion is necessary for population control of unwanted baby these abortion have been banned because the system support human trafficking child pornography etc the system need unwanted child to exist so that they can be abused in this way abortion should not be an option because a privileged couple wanted pregnancy didnt result in a healthy child it extremely sad but this couple want this child probably planned the pregnancy this child wont survive beyond his first year and thats heartbreaking but this child will never be subjected to child porn or trafficking abortion should not be an option because it inconvenient for the couple to care for their unhealthy child
abortion is healthcare
just travel out of the state suck it our reality but my wife and i just had a similar situation we live in texas and got the help we needed in new mexico
what doe the bible say about abortion
thats wrong
anti abortion law are inhumane it heartbreaking to still be fighting for basic human right for woman healthcare but we will keep fighting to make thing right im so sorry for all the woman affected by the current backwardness of the legal system i hope they all get compensation for their inhumane treatment
my cousin in europe wa told that her baby boy with the same condition when he wa born would live for 20 min they tried to convince her to abort she did not want to so she carried through with the pregnancy till full term delivered him and he passed away at exactly the time they told her he would she go to visit him daily for year it wa her son and she did not choose to abort i feel for you that the law have changed but i understand that he still is a human being with a brain and i pray that god give you the strength to endure this i wish you nothing but the best outcome possible
pro choice is not pro abortion it is pro patient make their own medical decision it is your choice not the government choice vote blue for you
it your body but your government choice sad world we live in
texas aint no fun when the rabbit got the gun is the saying about reversal of circumstance i do pray she survives this ordeal and teach her daughter about why woman should always vote to have reproductive control of their own body
i cant believe the leopard ate my face cry woman who voted for the leopard eating face party
now this is cruel i normally do not stand by abortion but in instance like this i would how cruel i feel for these parent
i hope she donates the organ so another baby can live
im pretty sure they are republican so this is what they deserve
the prolife party doesnt give a flying flip if woman die so much for prolife theyre all a bunch of lying hypocrite
then dont use it a birth control and mind your business remember no woman ever want to get an abortion they are not fun or easy everyone that get one ha to for whatever reason that is not our business i can not freaking believe we are having this stupid debate again federalist society scotus decision will cause woman to die it will not be different than 1971 they only prevent safe abortion with these law and this will not be the first woman forced to carry a dead fetus around for month and worse for these draconian religious zealot religious people need to remove themselves from other people bedroom and reproductive organ jfc like really what is wrong with yall dont give me some saving life line of crap woman are alive and you dont care about them universal healthcare save life why not back that
not all pregnancy are viable which is why abortion is healthcare caring a miscarriage can lead to sepsis this pregnancy wa wanted republican elected official have gone way to far it not a clear cut case of yes or no it a maybe
and if you voted republican at all thats what you voted for i know better my body is mine not yours and i have the right to choose whats best for me not you so if you voted for republican thats what you voted for sad isnt it
wow the people wishing ill on this woman are just a cruel a the people who voted for abortion to be illegal if she did vote for that then hopefully shell change after her experience sometimes thats what it take for some people thats what you wish on othersnot harm
texas and florida draconian law against woman
if you feel bad remember these people probably voted for trump and probably vote republican
she could easily drive to another state and get it done so she doesnt really care
this is what happens when you have extremist one side want abortion a birth control and the other side wont allow it when necessary
self righteous republican to blame for all these problem
no pity whatsoever you were ignorant and naive enough to vote and support abortion ban thinking that it wa mostly people using it a birth control statistically abortion are more common with miscarriage than used a birth control now that you see how detrimental the ban truly is you want sympathy fck no this is what happens when people let their emotion dictate their belief and choice pro choice isnt pro abortion pro choice mean i dont know what is going on in your life but you have the right to choose whats best for you yall made your bed now lay in it conservative need to learn to worry more about themselves and le about everyone else i said it before and ill it again the abortion ban is only the start of unnecessary control and the start of u reverting back a couple hundred year look at florida perfect example and texas seems to keep following in their footstep have fun with that
then you have these people that want to tell you how to live your life and when the table get turned and they have to follow their own rule they call it unfair unjust and they dont want to follow their own law
most not all only god know doctor only predict
i believe that in some case such a theirs is a compassionate option for both mother and baby
texas is so gross the other ohio
it sick to make a woman try and live a part of her life knowing there is a dead child inside her and having to still give birth
guess what yall she is not in control god is if i can carry a sick child so can she mine died in utero also i ddnt kill my child because they were sick still pro life when evil is called good in this world thats when you know the world is mad
this is what happens when you vote for gun over people abbott rule texas
what a nightmare for this woman
no one us it a birth control this is god showing you that
sound like this is the outcome she voted for welcome to the consequence of your own action
they passed this law because of god also god now watch me make a baby without a brain
is this what the texas govt want
not fair for her or other woman you dont say now here it is theyre trying to travel from state to state for help for their situation why not get the help in the state in which you live oh thats right how you vote took that choice away
who did they vote for
pop ha some pretty bad rosacea
this is why we need separation of church and state even in a cowardly state like texas
wheres the land of freedom and choice pushed by the repubs
god give u free will in every area of our life and let u make choice but somehow these unborn fetus are more precious than anything else he ever created and better not be touched and the woman he chose a the vessel for them do not have a say in anything regarding their pregnancy and they are the worst sinner on earth but not a bad a those gay people if they dare make a choice that harm that fetus even if it mean protecting her life by the way if you wan na own a gun and kill somebody thats alright conservative christian thinking be crazy
i felt sorry for her but this should be a lesson to all of you trump supporter who try to take away woman right when it happens to you now you understand your thought process wa wrong
since texas took control of the outcome of the pregnancy forced her to carry it to term until delivery then the state must shoulder the financial burden of all medical procedure related to pregnancy
republican listen tf up
this woman and her husband should be the only people who make the decision what to do in this situation what is wrong with people
not an advocate for birth control she say this show people only care about certain thing only when something happens to them or effect them i had a lot of sympathy at the start but lost a little after she said that now she know the pain other woman are going through
dont have sex thats how easy it is
im not advocating abortion but all in all this should be a woman personal choice
this is what they voted for this is what they get
the party of family value folk
i feel for them but a youve heard from her at 252 she is clearly regurgitating one of those prolife reason for being anti arbotion that abortion is being used by people a a form of birth control willynilly she clearly is anti abortion before all this happened to her she for sure is one of the people who celerated the overturning of roe now she see the effect of the abortion ban first hand all fun and game until it personally affect you i hope she get her abortion i hope she fight for that right now moving forward
just awful prayer for this family
unfortunately the people who are affected by this is quite small so the politician wouldnt careless this happen because people believe in the bible
firstly i am sorry that you are having to go through this but a a liberal texan this is what happens when you vote with no compassion you made your view known in the video and now that this is happening to you youre shocked i swear the prolife people are the absolute least compassionate people i know no grasp on reality or personal decision making within the boundary or established society
so she force to carry a baby thats doomed to die well she wanted this
not the baby fault doctor always say there 1 of living but that 1 can be a miracle baby
that is fk disgusting we will not let them ruin woman life like that these are monster a fk trauma
so grateful for these brave parent speaking out my story 24 year ago it take past 20 week to figure everything out i had to travel to another state please america come to your sens
that is what religion doe to society the american taliban will force others to hurt in the name of christianity
how traumatic added to a already stressful and traumatising time
they got what they voted for
they should sue the state of texas for mental stress damage due to her having to give birth to an unviable pregnancy it not ok she should have full medical care that doe include aborting a fetus especially that the fetus is unviable it ultimately her decision to make not the state of texas not anyone el decision no their body or life not their choice
creepy conservative asserting themselves in your life never end well
texas is sick
people so worried about abortion i wouldnt even have a kid in this society in the first placethey have nothing to aspire to anymore what to pay more have le credential are meaningless work experience is irrelevant it just social economic hierarchy based on thing that have zero tangible value truly embarrassing world we have created
