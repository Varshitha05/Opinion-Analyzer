notwitstanding the evisceration of roe v wade by the reactionary justice on the supremely political court of the united state these militant antichoicers will stop at absolutely nothing until they finally succeed in enshrining the patently odious concept of fetal personhood throughout the american polticial landscape should this extraordinarily unfortuante scenario ever become reality then the united state will definitely cease to be the land of the free and the home of the brave

good people defend the innocent protect young people evil is not prolife there is no abortion right debate it is all made up for communism ideology to thrive communist democrat narrative lie communist democrat character are above science science tell u when a human life begin science tell u male are biological male and female are biological female prolife republican character stand for truth truth is not a cult despite tyrant elitist globalist communist democrat lie an elitist scholarly woman in the uk literally said truth is a cult communist state give woman the right to murder the innocent abortion is a medical procedure to end a human life free people are not against abortion free people are against murder abortion used a a way to murder an individual is still murder abortion is intended to preserve life via selfdefense abortion is used to save the mother life in rare medical emergency
abortion ha killed more human in the past 100 year than all of the death in all the war in that time period thats a fact and disgusting abortion is murdering innocent unborn child
the fact that these people are forcing their choice on other people explains how backward humanity is more shocking from that side of the world imagine telling a rape victim to carry a pregnancy from rape god forbid like every other draconian and evil law it will be overturned one day no matter how they think they can impose it on people it criminal to take away people choice or make doctor indecisive to determine the best outcome for their patient horror god forbid again imagine the case of a man that raped his daughter and you want the daughter to keep a pregnancy she doe not want only evil people will support this people should be given a choice to decide with their body

for what it worth abortion wa not just legalit wa a safe condoned and practiced procedure in colonial america and common enough to appear in the legal and medical record of the period official abortion law did not appear on the book in the united state until 1821 and abortion before quickening did not become illegal until the 1860s if a woman living in new england in the 17th or 18th century wanted an abortion no legal social or religious force would have stopped her when the constitution wa written abortion wa acceptablelegal and practiced
the medium ha hoodwinked the public about this law the u supreme court did not ban abortion they argued that the decision on abortion had nothing to do with the constitution and the sc deal only with law related to the constitution so they handed the decicion over to state law allowing individual state law to regulate abortion instead of federal law no one ha banned these right across the entire country unless the american people vote to ban it on the state level why exactly did the republican objecting to the clintonpushed roe v wade law the legal objection wa to change the term from 9 month to a normal term around 24 week and then to allow each individual state to determine abortion law based on local vote and why roe v wade allowed woman to carry a baby to full term abort it in the last minute right before birth the truth wa that in some state woman for money became incubator for the clintonlegalized babyorgan trade carrying baby for 9 month simply so hospital could profit from the organ trade in the million the rep argued that this turned abortion into mu_der since the baby wa fully conscious at 9 month baby organ were openly traded and sold for enormous profit by hospital a trade considered illegal in most country

you got ta be born first to be considered a baby the definition of a baby is a very young child especially one newly or recently born newborn you got ta be born first to gain citizenship the 14th amendment all person born or naturalized in the united state and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizen of the united state and lastly you got ta be born first to have human right universal declaration of human right article 1 all human being are born free and equal in dignity and right born human have clear and concise statement in all of our declaration whats not clear are the right of unborn human the unborn might be human being but either way according to our declaration human being must be born to inherit all these right here a great example of clear language protecting unborn human ireland 8th amendment to recognise the equal right to life of the mother and the unborn without this kind of language in our declaration unborn right are not a clear a born right advocating unborn right will require reinterpretation of current declaration implied interpretation do not override whats factual and clear the official definition of the actual word being used in these declaration born right are clear unborn right must be clear first in order to even debate overturning the right of the born human carrying the unborn human
there is nothing respectable about the anti abortion folk you guy didnt even make a nice life for the roe v wade baby all of u adoptee are shortchanged and none of u deserve to have to live with you guy abortion is better
the question of whether or not to have an abortion concern only the mother and the father if there is one abortion is not something that affect the whole population it is the responsibility of the mother and the father if there is one it is not like vaccination where if you are not vaccinated you can put other people at risk the same go for gun law so the question is why do you care what other people do with their own life when it ha nothing to do with you why do you feel entitled to tell them how to live
it make me so sick the lack of empathy or humanity people have for mother who need abortion some of them want their baby but their told their baby will be born dead can someone tell me what is the point of forcing a mother to continue with a pregnancy for a baby that ha a 0 chance of being born alive i know some religious woman want to keep it so it can be baptised but thats the mother choice fetal demise is more common than people think one woman had to wait for the inevitable miscarriage which wa very painful because she couldnt have an abortion right away for a baby that wa always going to die her chance of having another successful pregnancy had significantly been reduced because her uterus had been damaged all the abortion law did wa reduce her chance of having child

anyone who really belief abortion is murder and want to prevent it would support birth control counseling low cost birth control covered by healthcare sex education regardless of age they would also support universal prenatal and postnatal healthcare provide healthcare to child and support subsidized nonprofit high quality daycare to give that baby the every chance at life i have never ever heard any prolife politician or political spokesperson voice support for any of these measure that would easily prevent million of abortion

but because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of god wrath when his righteous judgment will be revealed god will repay each person according to what they have done to those who by persistence in doing good seek glory honor and immortality he will give eternal life but for those who are selfseeking and who reject the truth and follow evil there will be wrath and anger there will be trouble and distress for every human being who doe evil first for the jew then for the gentile but glory honor and peace for everyone who doe good first for the jew then for the gentile roman 2510 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in u if we confess our sin he is faithful and just to forgive u our sin and to cleanse u from all unrighteousness 1 john 89 if you openly declare that jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved for it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with god and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved a the scripture tell u anyone who trust in him will never be disgraced roman 10911 by god grace the gift of salvation and eternal life is available to all you can receive it you can reject it may you choose wisely
doe the main person that helped turn over roe v wade a lady i truely wonder if she ha kid and even better to know she can not produce one and is she mad that she hears people can have kid by happy mistake and tragic mistake to witch should be the person decission kid are for life a debt that a poor person can not do in his her work life school and list go on the kid that are grown up in a household that is always broke creates alot more harm then being able to get abortion some parent trapped and no where else to go a bottledrugs in turn have there parent hating there kid for this i really would like to know if kristan hawkins can not have kid and hating on the one that can and can not afford having a kid in there current state of life it just sickening to hear that a person raped now ha to raise the rapist kid wtf
i just dont understand how can some of those people twist the idea that you are giving back something to people when you are in fact letting government remove right remove freedom and dictate what woman can and can not do with their own body treating them in such a discriminate way yet another step into theocracy the brainwashing must be deep for people who can not feel cognitive dissonance from such a logical contradiction and again the problem with all of these people is that they are preaching rule that dont have the effect they idealize in their head in reality because they purposefully remain ignorant and dont look at real life statistic data and refuse to listen to what the scientific community is saying it trying to pas law applies rule and see the world according to their uninformed idealistic and ignorant assumption rather than working with science and year of recorded history to understand the problem in what they are proposing the whole problem of trying to criminalize abortion is that you can not stop abortion by criminalizing it we have century of history to prove that it exactly because no woman in the real world would ever consider an abortion if it wasnt her last choice no woman will even enter an abortion procedure a if it wa a choice about walking in the park or not this ridiculous demeaning and quite frankly sexist idea that woman would go to an abortion clinic like they go to a tanning saloon is just plain idiotic and so it doesnt matter what the law say if you have someone desperate for an abortion they will always go with whatever choice that is available legal illegal safe clinic back alley a scientific accredited procedure or a coat hanger we all know this or we should all know this and trying to turn an eye to this truth is just evil it seems to me like a trace of sociopathy making abortion legal isnt about more abortion it about making the procedure safe it about regulating and supervising the procedure properly it about saving life of woman who need this very basic access to healthcare that is being taken away from them by politics and extremism a well regulated abortion clinic and practice actually protects woman and in several case end up protecting baby too despite what radical will say it creates a web of support that prevents woman from being coerced into it by abusive spouse abusive parent abusive boyfriend and whatnot this is an entire whole point that is being lost there illegal clinic wont care about that and wont have proper procedure to prevent those so not only you are removing choice from woman you are also empowering abusive relationship to end up in abortion case because you are removing the legality of it which force the practice to go underground the real problem with the prolife people is misinformation idealism and trying to fight an invisible enemy they dont comprehend on purpose
stop having premarital sex stop having drunk sex wear a condom take the pill get married first these are crazy thought right much easier to do rather than getting an abortion aka killing a defenseless baby which end their life trigger your lifelong guilt and put your lifehealth at extreme risk like bleeding to death after the procedure loosing ability to have future child and std from extremely risky behavior it like smoking the label say dont youre harming yourself but some do it anyway human seek godwho command encourages and promotes loving monogamous married relationship maybe you avoid having to considering an abortion in the first place
what republican say abortion is wrong we must stand up for the right of the unborn what republican think more baby equal more target practice in school yeehaw
but that is the thing medical bill are expensive and insurrection company are not cheap and dont always pay for medical bill like giving birth so retail company love to put child clothing nappy formula and toy up very high then you got other bill like gas electric water mortgage and more like food are expensive enough and that mean parent work longer hour for very little pay and skip meal so their child can get sleep and go to school also the number of child abuse is far worse a some people only have child to get benefit and not love care and be a parent to a child that would love them until that uncaring and abusive parent kill them abortion actually save life and dying in their mother arm is more worse because that is physical abuse to the woman i am prochoice i will accept whatever choice the woman want who are we to listen to someone telling u woman what to do with our body my exhusband told me because he is my husband he can tell me what to do like have seven child and to not get a tattoo and ruin my body well it is my body not a man or anyone el to do with

abortion advocate are trying to push for termination up till the point of birth that mean killing a fully formed healthy baby that can survive outside the womb simply out of spite there no justification of excuse for it theyre baby killer and murderer woman wonder why they have historically been oppressed it because everytime they are given right they eventually push for baby killing and it fall to the men of society and put a stop to their heinous reprehensible evil action
it pretty simple the state where the population want to reduce access can do and the state that want full access can do thats pretty much the impact roe v wade ha had
more woman will just die at the end of the day some woman cant carry long term due to other complication with pregnancy a lot of woman can die in pregnancy in general so essentially they are saying kill them both if an abortion is needed

my deepest condolence go out to this woman with a miscarriage no matter what this is a very difficult time that ive walked through with many of my patient this example is ridiculous though im a medical doctor and the safest way for a miscarriage to pas is naturally if this woman is passing the product of conception naturally this is the best medical option mifepristonemisoprostol are the second line treatment option for a pregnancy loss before 12 week dilation and curettage are third line treatment this patient had the best outcome after a sad happenstance
america is so phuced glad i live in australia
if they want to stop abortion they better offer to raise the baby or give them enough money to raise them note that they care about the unborn until it come out of the vagina then it your problem not having money is a big thing there are people in the world who have starving child and have to watch them die is that humane
i appreciate how humanized this news piece ha been but i also want to know the data have partial or full hysterectomy gone up since the ban have woman been dying more due to pregnancy complication maybe a sharp uptick in new baby being released to the state mental health issue substance abuse issue have woman been moving out of these antiabortion state if they cant move are there underground abortion provider again if it be the case that this information is unavailable because these state are not collecting this information i would think that would be an important thing to add

the problem for the united state is that the republican and democrat contradict each other on abortion and mass shooting they are extreme in each case
the way the leftist have brainwashed kid now and disregarded biology completely they have now lost all creditability in this issue
frankly no idea why anyone else should be butting in with what a woman doe with her own body it her choice simply no one el business those who bore on about the right of the unborn seem to be overestimating human life im willing to bet that if you ask 100 people randomly whether they would have wanted to be born knowing what we do a human the vast majority of them would decline the offer invariably it those holy roller who adhere to primitive scripture written by men thousand of year ago who cause all the trouble here it no accident that abortion right are such a hot topic in the u a country with an alarmingly high belief in invisible daddy in the sky preventing legal access to abortion doesnt stop abortion from happening it just prevents safe abortion a woman will seek dangerous underground method if the legal option is denied them another thing thats always confused me in this debate is how the prolifers in the u are oh so keen to protect the life of the unborn by denying legal access to abortion but are quite free and easy with the life of the born and are all for any tom dick or dirty harry buying a gun like theyre buying candy from a store and going out and shooting up a school every other week seems like there a contradiction there personally my only issue with abortion is pain doe the unborn foetus feel pain on this basis it should be done a early a possible in the gestation but the bottom line here is simple it a woman right to choose what she doe with her own body
first it is nonsense to suggest that the law never tell people what they can or can not do with their body in fact there are many thing which people are not legally allowed to do with their body to name just a few they can not sell them for sex or sell their organ to people who need transplant or put certain drug into their body
prolife until after it is born not prolife for the woman or the kid after it is born
if prolifers didnt want to be hypocrite making abortion illegal should have been their last priority making abortion illegal doesnt stop abortion from happening it only stop safe abortion from happening instead of woman going to a doctor to undergo the procedure woman will try to give themselves abortion through unsafe method strong sex education class and easy access to free birth control are the only effective way of reducing the actual number of abortion people wont get abortion if you give them the tool to not get pregnant in the first place however conservative state routinely try to cut back on both of these while still condemning abortion prolifers go on and on about saving the life of the child but what about the quality of life for that child have prolifers improved america poor foster care system have they fought to provide financial aid to new mother who cant afford the child that they didnt want because they couldnt afford them i havent heard prolifers mention anything about what they are willing to do to support these unwanted child the united state ha poor sex education access to birth control is restricted in one way or another in many part of the nation our foster care system ha been neglected and having child will often financially ruin woman who didnt want child yet despite all those issue prolifers continue to support keeping abortion illegal which only exacerbates those issue the action of prolifers andor lack of action show their true intention prolifers dont really care about the child they only care about punishing woman for being sexually active that is the outcome of making abortion illegal it will make woman suffer they want woman to suffer because those woman arent conforming to their ideal and belief
you at least have the humanity of a child dying in their mother arm bruh how do you even come to such a awful conclusion oh yeah instead of letting an adultmother decide on their own let just decide it best for that person to have a baby die in their arm
you do not have the right to murder innocent unborn baby you sick freak
protect the innocent child from these evildoer
science make it very clear that preborn child are human being it a scientific fact that life begin at fertilization with the baby having his or her own unique individual dna strand entirely separate from their mother within the first trimester alone the baby ha a beating heart measurable brain wave unique fingerprint and the ability to respond to touch
america ha a problem with cause and effect
and america think it a free country haha
it astonishes me that a country which still ha the death penalty doesnt allowed abortion in any sense for some state
god this is depressing
what about the innocent life because it is murder the answer is responsible sex using contraceptive
freedom to people of usa from american democracy
this world need god
funny most european country have had more restriction than the usa up until now
also hollywood need to stop promoting the wild sex culture that spawn disrespect for woman and baby
democrat at to blame here if they had not pushed the abortion with no restriction up to birth and no care for born but unwanted baby the american people would not have wanted to reverse roe
the woman at 650 i wonder if she would be happy to carry a pregnancy to term go through the traumatic experience that is birth for her child to die in her hand thats such a stupid and entitled statement
what these people leave out is if the baby is gon na put the mother life at risk is it really worth it for her dying or having severe body damage even if the baby life
the risk is female led eugenics ive been pregnant but i recently discovered that the father wear a toupeeso i no longer want the baby i think the scale risk being tipped too far in favor of woman a to who get to decide who livesreproduces and who doesnt because the poorbaldshortblackbrownuglyfat whateveralso have a right to be born safely and not be aborted because the irresponsible mother ha now decided that she nolonger find red hair attractive indeed it is true that we are all eugenicists to a certain extent deciding on the characteristic that we want in a baby but that decision should better be made at the time before a woman decides on whether to go ahead with the sexual act and not after the baby already exists a human life is not an iphone that you are choosing from a store shelf color no longer trendy no problem just get another one otherwise why did we fight the nazi who had their own national eugenics program that sought to make everyone beautiful tall blond smart and perfectly healthy in fact listening to a modern western woman list of requirement for men is eerily like reading himmler list of requirement for the s where is the compassion here exactly the equality and it is not surprising that the feminist camp are pro abortion because other than woman right it represents ultimate control over men i dont see them fighting to include men in this important decision making process let u see once men have been reduced to walking sperm receptacle that woman can procur from whether they have the respect for antidiscrimination and tolerance that they say they do a abortion commercializes human life
it not nice to murder a child in the womb that ha to be chopped up to be removed shame on you
god law is higher whatever wot is wot wherever that lead
do antiabortion men know how woman feel during their pregnancy and giving birth it unimaginably painful and unpleasant especially if a biological father is a rapist
it not the land of the free here it the land of fascism america is a nightmare to live in
the problem with taking away woman right is that you are opening a door that put u back to past first it our right to our body next will be our position at work mostly due to fact of child care but we have been fighting for equality at work for year after that they will go after the education system for female student slowly and carefully if we allow them they will end up putting woman back in their place notice the quotation mark because they are too weak and scared of our intelligence
it cost about 40k to adopt a child in the u why is that
andrew tate destroyed bbc propaganda
at 20 week an unborn baby not foetus can feel pain move dream suck it thumb and make facial expression stop killing kid you evil cnts
personal responsibility
hey bbc why arent you uploading the interview you did with andrew tate whats going on
who amon you have no sin be the one cast the first stone this is what i remember from the bible no health situation should be judged by the court or government plus i cant stand the fact of people outside the clinic or posting comment against others in any situation especially when they are quoting the bible or religious belief because if they are very religious a they say then what happened to the do not judge others only god ha the right to judge and most importantly who among you have no sin be the one to cast the first stone
id respect their view if the same people were stood outside care home and adoption agency offering support to the baby who have been born there i said it
that picture paint a thousand word
no one asks how bbc is going cook these dead foteus and serve to meat eater
were doing great here it crazy that woman not being able to kill their own fetus in the womb a some form of petty primitive birth control stir so much controversy
the prochoice crowd ha had over 30 year to weed out all the unwanted people and no one can argue that theyve been stingy in carrying out the death sentence so far theyve butchered between 45 and 50 million baby and they continue to kill them at the rate of over 3000 a day meanwhile we are asked to ignore the fact that since this holocaust began america ha suffered huge increase in teen pregnancy homelessness hunger welfare divorce poverty child abuse spousal abuse deadbeat dad gang illegal drug sexually transmitted disease high school drop out and the list go on and on
bbc want to kill baby
both side need to meet in the middle
totally unbiased view from the bbc abortion is the murder of a child it is that simple i cant believe how sick our culture ha become that we think murdering child is health care in the ancient roman world infant exposure wa totally acceptable so why not also make it legal to murder child outside the womb if we decide we dont want it
very one sided coverage no mention about the right of the unborn baby only the right of the woman
infographics like you used set u back and is why we have a hard time convincing old men what abortion really are stop showing full grown baby
baby killer have no place on planet earth this is lion world not muppet world
it not your body therefore there shouldnt be a choice to kill an innocent child
there should never be an abortion exemption for alleged rape it is too easy for a desperate female who made a bad decision and regret becoming pregnant to falsely accuse an innocent male of rape so she can gain access to abortion
the claim that she wa raped which she admitted wa a lie
you were a fetus once
god is clear thou shall not kill anything moreless is not from god but from the bbc cnn and from satan
it interesting how increasing democracy in term of aborting unborn child ha panned out people from the extreme on both side of the argument have been highlighted frequently in the medium a usual the reasonable approach lie somewhere in between
abortion is beautiful
woman sitting on the floor and men arresting them for being prochoice freedom america whooo what a terrible goverment glad i live in the netherlands

abortion should be banned or atleast lowered to max 6 week term only exception should be severe illness
the blocking wa in the right direction
thank god im not in america nutjobs
unless the woman wa raped or the father doesnt say it hiswants to be the father or no father is found only then should it be allowed there so many preventative measure in place we have in 2023 there should be no excuse for your stupid action on getting pregnant by accident from your own incompetence for you to then kill the child you could have chose not have unprotected sex

abortion is to kill
i am pro lifewish i had all five kid
if a woman get raped and ha a baby on the way then carry it until it is borned the put it up for adoption but in the same aspect if carrying this unborn baby endangers the mother life then i would agree to having a abortion to save the mom life but that is the only way i would agree to having one now here come the kicker some woman have child that are on welfare in order to keep the money coming into the house and a lot of them have no idea who the father are so the taxpayer again have to support these family for ever it becomes a way of life for generation of these garbage people passed on from generation to generation i would like to see welfare defunded and make these people get off of their butt and work for a living or work for the money they are getting from the government it used to be this way back in the 40 and 50 and some of the 60 there isnt anything free in this world because someone ha to pay for it
demicrats wanted the law changed to allow baby murder even after a healthy baby wa born the party of evil
notice how the bbc doesnt highlight a woman murdering her baby because it would be inconvenient
the fact that a woman can get raped and is then forced by law to carry the child until birth is horrific this ha to change
how could you ever trust a woman who kill her own child for those who say it wa unplanned then why did you have sex ever heard of the word responsibility
i think education system of u ha failed miserably
these woman just want to sleep around like street girl and when they get pregnant they just want to run from consequence by getting an abortion
christian moron doing what christian moron do bestbeing moron
those people who harassed woman outside the clinic should provide child support to those they support abortion ban how else can baby survive without nutrition shelter and clothes diaper if they can not support the baby leave woman alone to decide for themselves i think they just want future slave born into poverty
american are retrogressive see the woke agenda destroying our country
a lot of these prolife idiot stop losing interest of the baby after it born none of them will even take care of orphan they dont understand that there may be a legitimate reason for the abortion termination eg risk to mother life rape incest financial change low quality of life of the child if born severely disabled lack of support given to the motherchild the mother may not be ready to hold life yet accidentsetc
dirty community
people said that the grim reaper is at charelss cornationi dont if it real or not maybe that the grim reaper is trying to find queen elizebeth 2 corpse
simone veil one of the greatest defender of abortion right would be so appalled by the deteriorating situation in the u
the most disingenuous part of this is that if these people really supported an abortion ban they would be the one lining up to adopt two or three kid they arent but they are sure a heck lining up to get fertility treatment and ivf antiabortion proponent do not in fact care about others keeping their unborn to term and birthing them they are so desperate to have their own that they ignore every reason others do not and worse that abortion are often needed for reason other than any choice in the matter if there were an honest way of balancing this at all coming from antiabortion proponent there might be more support for their legislation but there isnt it all over restrictive nonsense that doe not consider the only one who ha any consciousness in the matter at all
1035 maybe practice safe sex and dont be promoting it like it something to be proud of
