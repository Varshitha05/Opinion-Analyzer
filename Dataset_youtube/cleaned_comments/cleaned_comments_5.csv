in essence the supreme court is inherently a political entity where consideration such a logic reason and the protection of citizen often take a back seat to political dynamic
best court money can buy
what a surprise conservative lie they hide how horrible even they know they are until they can destroy from within just like any other cancer
abortion is a privilege
people with seven child have no right to decide the fate of others they have proved themselves completely irresponsible
they all should be going to jail for perjury they all lied on their confirmation hearing
so according to kantor all judicial compromise effort become irrevocably hopeless based solely on thing happening in the medium but the deceptive medium they put out to the american public we dont know if were going to take the case despite all evidence and fact represents a window of judicial persuasion that literally doe not occur in any real or symbolic way why doe she feel she ha license to invent these reporting narrative out of thin air
oh i shouldve looked who reporting kn this
clarence thomas should recuse himself period
donald trump is a traitor to the nation and he deserve to be on jail for a long time nobody is above the constitutional rule of this country nobody period if they supreme court judge if they dont give a big punishment to donald trump they deserve to be removed from the chair period
the judge on this court are corrupt and biden should appoint more judge to ballance it out and change the job from a lifetime job to a 5 year appointment they can be removed if they are using their position to push a political agenda instead of looking at legal argument funny how they are promoting state right when it benifits the republican party but if you change state right to gun reform it suddenly becomes a constitutional one
just look at the smug smile of these people

i always suspect that the supreme court is corrupt to the bone did we notice that trump never criticize the supreme court trump pack the court we with his supporter because hebwant them to rule in his favourthats why why trump want to go to the suprime court to declare him over the law total immunity over the constitution of the the usa
they know you all wont do anything but angrily post online about it
they say that trump will still on the ballot doe that mean that we dont follow the constitution anymore he not only wa involved in the insurrection he is to blame for the whole thing i just dont get it no man is above the law and yet trump is how is this possible and why isnt he in prison where he belongs the supreme court swore an oath to uphold the constitution why dont they in this case
justice dont change law they judge case based on the law which is based on interpretation of the context of a case a the law applies congress is the only one who can change or make law however the court can rule on it a they deem fit per the letter of the law and the constitution
the fed never should have been involved in this to begin with up until a child is viable outside of the womb it is part of the person
these judge are a honest a trump
abortion never wa a constitutional right it should be an issue left to the individual state i am not for a national ban it should be decided by the state
the scotus is compromised

these people have destroyed the integrity of the supreme court
scotus is obviously infected with maggot and is proving allegiance to the insurrectionist and their farright antidemocratic agenda watch out american your will soon live in a dictatorship if you dont pay attention
to be prolife is to recognize the inherent value of every human being regardless of their stage of development
i hate this idea that we should read anything in justice cb taking any kind of stand mean we should evaluate her character maybe warm up a seat on the resistance high council like we did for megan kelley no absolutely not
what the justice seems to have forgotten is that a a justice they need to leave their personal feeling at the door their job ha nothing to do with how they personally feel about a case they are weighing in on they are suppose to be deciding whats right or wrong according to our constitution if they cant leave their personal feeling at the door they need to find another line of work same for cop it not about you
i want to tell you again for the second time or third time there is someone who is hijacking your n and bc podcasts and putting them on her site we can not find them on the regular site please look into this
this is appalling if trump get immunity in his case that mean immunity for biden also and we must rally for him to stay in office
how much did the supreme corrupt judge get paid off to reverse the will of the people
if biden win 1124 dear god please please please and ha a majority house and senate he should add 4 justice to the court we have 13 district we should have 13 justice then pas a law stating you can only rise of justice when district reach an odd 1517 etc
america is under attack from christian sharia law
it funny how mad corrupt people get at whistleblower the supreme court ha a long distinguished history of betraying the trust of the people
conservative we should execute whoever leaked that draft reporter look like it wa leaked by conservative to try to solidify the vote conservative
idc where you stand on abortion but the supreme court should be impartial and fair to everyone
chris hayes alleges that something is a great piece translation it a moronic piece that wasnt worth the writing of it i notice that the loyal loony of the left are out in farce in the comment section quelle surprise just to be clear on the issue of vote they had the vote to both take an overturn casey roe wa already a dead letter by the work of casey a usual chris hayes is working hard to be the head clown in the car reading all sort of idiotic thing into the world they werent waiting for rbg to die to do anything her vote wa irrelevant it take 4 vote to hear a case and they had that it take 5 vote to overturn a precedent since hayes isnt all that bright and neither is this reporter he interviewing they had one extra vote than they needed also kantor is attempting to sell people on the idea that she ha inside information to the justice conference she doe not no one doe shes just doing her job her one an only job sell copy fiction is a fantastic tool of journalist for the same reason it is for other folk who make bank off of making thing up

if we wanted a supreme court thats not politicized wed have devised a method of seclection that excluded bias the business of presidential selection ensures bias and in disturbed time like ours the wheel fall off completely and the whole process of going to the supreme court becomes a farce why not make a list of all those who want to be on the supreme court and choose the winner using the lotto selector the country is going to have to do something like that or continue down the path to a continuation of the civil war how many more warning do we need
i never understood why they did it because roe wa the republican golden goose they had a topic they could take to their supporter and fund raise off of endlessly they could scream and yell and cry and shake hand and do nothing and ride that easy money wave
i had been holding it down for day but thanks to this piece i wasnt able to hold back my gag reflex proving once again there no bottom but only new low
scotis is way broken and a prime example of the importance of term limit
it is utterly dillisional to think thwt the leak had any effect on the outcome of dobbs covering the surpreme court must really make you think this institution is not utterly corrupted by politcal power unfortunately by any conceivable measure of the court there is no deliberation at all here merely an exercising of power
remember them they will enter history a one of the most corrupt and untrustworthy justice to have ruled america we wont forget the like of them so we can put justice of higher intergrity into the supreme court someone worthy who is nothin like them
oh nancy pelosi and chuck schumer accountable they are the corrupted people if you do that you hold the bright people responsible for it and you will start looking like a are real smart person right now all your lunatic look like you all confused
yeah whatever it is it not a bombshellthis supreme court is the fault of lazy progressive democrat
sorry amy your weak but i didnt want to hear the case died when you sided with the other judge to overturn it
the court corrected a bad decision whats wrong with that roe v wade wa based upon something that doe not exist the right to privacy
kentucky voter are to blame for repeatedly voting for the monster in my opinion next to hitler mcconnell is the worst human beingever
scotus role all need to have a term limit a do all public office competent oversight should be appointed by a committee of unbiased professional not a president have minimum qualification be evaluated and investigated prior to assuming the role be subject to the same benefit and law a citizen there should only be one set of benefit and law and more some of these topic may seem to be covered but theyre not a majority of the present scotus appointee are corrupt andor incompetent
dad go to meg spearman two minute
if ruth actually retired while obama wa president that would have been incredibly helpful lol
these 6 hold the future of u democracy in their hand unfortunately there is not one honest or ethical person making up the 6
make no mistake scotus is highly political and the power monger have helped to tilt the scale of justice
ordinairy business and lobby club
who say we live in postironic time the supreme court upset about the leak that exposed their secret decision to nullify roe v wade the sc lost all trust with me not that i ever respected them the fbi or other actor in our government the bubblican party is void of ethic
people worry about a trump coup and it already happened when he packed the supreme court with corrupt minion
if she had just retired when obama wa president this would never have happened
the leak wa alito who wa 100 playing politics and wanting to legislate from the bench
from mr billy ray chessher 3bc1 nicknamed mr superman 3bc1 from the united state of america the justice league of america yeah all american woman get their right to 100 total say n choice n decision what they do or dont do with body n which all woman should have 100 total control of their very own body yeah praise god almighty thank u god
power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely john emerich edward dalbergacton 1st baron acton 13th marquess of groppoli better known a lord acton and thus we have the supreme justice drunk with absolute power
over time i simply think all this establishes is how corrupt and political the supreme court is and the fact that there were no consequence for the leaker reinforces the idea that we have a supreme court that itself feel it is above the law between this and all the payoff and outright bribery weve learned about all with nothing being done it just show what a banana republic the u ha really become
the supreme court justice are more like court jester for whoever take care of them
thanks to judgment to supreme court justice to usa
the republican voted judge are against all freedom all choice and there all apart of the kkk they work against the ppl they dont work for the ppl the kkk are in the supreme court
we can always tell
they all need to be fired from those seat why cant we vote for who in those position i hate our political system
kantor spends too much time making coneybarrett a hero in this article when in fact she ultimate decides to overturn roe i dont get her kantors nuance here
look what republican voter have to ignore look what democrat voter cant ignore
sobasically they are playing with our life
it blatant and in our facesmsnbc doe the bidding of the white house

the party of trump pot the maga are all high on pot
when a supreme court judge take a oath to our constitution pledge elegance to our flagwhen questioned at interview they lied so aint is why they must be removed for lying being giving false statement
end of genocidal medical procedure
i am trying to have a baby now but if this pass i would gladder wait until i can move out of the country for good usa is sinking quick
it only about control because if you believe in god then why are you not going to trust him to judge kate not you that is proof politician do not trust in god to punish her
supreme court is bipartisan or political my butt
why not ban all live birth to compensate for the population surge on our southern border
this is rgb fault that hungry b hadnt retired we wouldnt be in this mess
the breach of trust are the politician mateguarding scotus nominee to preserve roe v wade law should be decided by the people not 7 liberal justice in 1973
thats the crooked game republican play hi allito top crook judge we see you
term limit
god said do unto others a you have them do unto you
sound like god removed her from the planet and than he replacde her with a pro life judge
whats with the attempt to white wash coney barrett she voted to nix abortion in the end which is what matter
the will not stop at roe
barret voted against knowing it would still be taken red herring
i commend jodi for keeping such a level head and stating the fact during this interview this guy can be a bit leading im liberal and all but i really dont like his style in this interview like he trying to rile people up into a frenzy it reminiscent of the crap they play on the right
psh this could have happened 10 year later and we would have known it wa because she died whats funny is these people dont have to worry about reelection or some crap the supreme court is too political
again i say wtaf with lifetime appointment america we can be so freaking stupid
this sound like let forgive barrett because shes a woman in power and feminism exists what a joke
justice which shouldnt follow political line complaining when theyre called out for pushing their political view
i love this liberal propaganda the leak may have been inappropriate because the justice could have changed their vote yeah right and trump can admit that he committed all the crime he done over the past five year
418 come on lady this is your cue to say that thing we talked about you saying
if this anger you remember trump is taking the credit for this
american christian taliban
trying to insert reason and justice into a 50 year long political hatchet job is ludicrous
dont understand why it a question abortion is a human right
reform is required no lifetime appointment more justice and a balance across all party including independent all for starter having the ayatem a it is oppresses the majority of the population
this is why we need to abolish the electoral college these religious nut have an insane amount of power over u those are living in 2023
in 1953 my greatgreat uncle found four strangled newborn hidden in his field my aunt told me about a much older cousin who had three abortion in secret to avoid raising kid with a violent husband this wa in the day before roe and these are the day were going back to when abortion happened in secret and when actual fresh living baby were killed silently when abortion were denied
dont look at mei voted for hillary
america hold itself a a moral paragon while being one of the most corrupt duplicity even the judiciary
i thought we all knew it wa saltamayor
being able to buy a supreme court justice is corruption by definition
i cant say i have much confidence in the supreme court i dont believe that the justice are primarily interested in the law i dont believe the american people are foremost in the justice mind they have become political animal who make law secondary to power politics
a whole ton of revisionist history in this the fact remains they had the vote before and after the leak the took the case before the leak they negated the will of the majority of people before the leak the leak wa never a problem for these people they wanted to destroy the will of the majority of american thats the sole reason they were put there
amy coney barret be smiling at sc portrait like she deserves to be there
beach of trust you crook
are we still complaining about having lost roe v wade it awful genuinely but there are so many other story that the news should be tackling and refuse to obviously this is about politics and power youd be dumb to expect anything else the fact this is still in the news cycle show that it not a pressing issue but a distraction from what matter what is our government doing right now
so do kantor and liptak know who leaked the document and why and just cant say due to journalistic ethic or do they literally not know
at this point there is no one who hate woman than the hard christian right we might a well live in afghanistan and iran
i have no respect for some of these justice
the supreme court should take case regardless of how it appears they shouldnt take politics into account at all this isnt at all like taking gift
correct me if im wrong acb pulled a rico
the reason amy coney barret or whatever her name is voted against taking up the case so soon after rbg died wa because she didnt want to look bad it wasnt because of some great soulsearching moment she had or anything like that she didnt want to look like a tacky person plowing into one of rbgs most fiercely protected topic while her chair wa still warm
abortion is wrong in our eye a christian from conception but if not in others and it legal it should have limit on the age
developed feeling pain in a awful degree
it sound like you want to unsurp god job a which he doe a good enough job at beingthat he can have a miscarriage happened or help save both life if possibe at least still born rok yes but they do saline abortion up to 21 24 week burning a baby alive in the womb it wrong morally
who leaked it though that is the big question that wa just kind of dropped by the investigation wa it a justive wa it a staffer were there any conaequences whatsoever
i have very little trust in the u how many more step until the country will turn into a religious extremist dictatorship what is the next step after this remove voting right for woman a it is against god will for woman to have right
no one is entitled to anyone el body period
that is a huge pile of male bovine fecal matter talk to a lady named anita hill yet the so called justice got approved to the supreme court money talk lady justice is supposed to be blind but lady justice can here money talking
what doe it matter if she voted against hearing it 6 minus 1 is still more than the 4 they needed i dont care about symbolic action that do nothing she just wanted to protect her own optic and when push came to shove she still voted to axe roe v wade
yeah not always true i have electric heat in each room
this conservative majority in the supreme court is an abomination and an embarassment theyre overtly political agent
the supreme court is a farce anytime they split party line we know it is politics when that 54 vote win we know something is deeply wrong with the justice not always with the ruling but with those who are on the bench 1 term limit 2 unanimous decision ruling required 3 only 3 justice ruling per case selected unanimously by the other justice 4 at year 5 a congressional review of the justice or opportunity to step down
so this entire decision wa made on partisan buddy politics and not actually the word of the constitution nice to finally have confirmation the supreme court is in fact partisan
im for abortion up to the 240th trimester in certain case
for some reason i thought that the court wasnt deciding the issue until theyve heard all of the evidence from both side silly me
who care barrett voted to overturn roe and that is what matter
democrat cant tell you what a woman is they think men can get pregnant
trump judge all lied to get on the bench they knew before they even got on the bench they were going to do what they could to over turn roe they have a lot of nerve to have a problem with the leak they have no respect for the seat a liar dont belong in the supreme court the most honest people should be on it highest court
worst scotus ever impeach alito and thomas amend constitution to install term limit for the justice continually monitor their gift bribe
besides trump our supreme court ha become a group of crook and liar and that should say alot about the right winger taking control of our nation 1 thing at a time
it crystal clear that ramming these judge through wa an agenda to overturn law and precedent to rewrite law based on religion not law it an attack on the court system from within
this leak shouldnt shock anyone supreme court justice are merely human with their own individual opinion of right and wrong and stockholder with investment in a variety of corporation our sociopolitical landscape ha always been a battle between theocratic and secular ideal add to that the intelligenceorganized crime corporationgovernment partnership running our world economy and what we end up with are three branch of government legislative executive and judicial focused solely on social baby sitting a population brought up with nonsensical belief in an invisible primatedeity our entire understanding of right and wrong in based in false dogma and nonexistent god we need a new plan
yeah more free gift vacation from trump for the republican judge
from the river to the sea
could we not say abortion leak wordsmithing is a thing
i trusted scotus but no more it bipartisan now not law thomas is on the take with all his freebee he is own by the rich
judge at any level should not have a personal opinion on any legal review especially at the highest level i realize it not always realistic for personal opinion not to influence a ruling when a judge is at any level of appeal it should simply be wa the original decision wrong legally wa something done wrong that would change the outcome when it come to a person right is the existing law or decision unconstitutional nationally or locally the reversal of roe didnt say abortion is wrong it simply stated that the law should be made locally not nationally state are already making law but in my opinion it should be made by a referendum before the state congress make decision some state say no abortion for any reason after 6 week which is ridiculous
your judicial system need a complete reset it appears to be corrupted by politics from top to bottom
this is just wasting our time
i find this to be a total abomination that one person one vote can affect ten if not a hundred million of american thats just playing nutz
the comment section is gon na be a place of civil discourse with no vitriol whatsoever
trump kavenaugh and thomas are the main reason why abortion should be legal because coward will never admit to taking advantage a woman should always have the final say when it come to her body regardless the outcome is between the woman and god
all of this because rbg hubris refusing to retire while obama wa in the office and the dem controlled both chamber of congress yea the gop packed the court and overturned the rvw but the dem party also played with your life by thinking and assuming clinton would win and she can name rbgs replacement instead of being responsible they played with this and the people ended up paying for it
it wa a left wing democrat
these asswipes were hoping to publish their ruling and then skip off on vacation right after and hide until the firestorm blew over but someone thankfully leaked the detail out and they were caught red handed lol
i mean are they an objectively evil immoral person or are they prochoice
hoping the overturning roe v wade mean state mamdate you have to get vaccinated and must donate your organ at death
to be fair we didnt need that leak the gop ha made it their goal for half a century to overturn roe v wade whether it constitutional or not the second there wa a republican majority made by trump i knew roe v wade wa dead
cia or nsa leak
this court is a sham they lie to american they take money from foreign government they have become so political it sad
the supreme court more like the s court
you cant trust fellow criminal chief justice
the republican supreme court is a corrupt and dishonest body the idea that no one is above the law is up for sale and the conservertives have cornered the market
it terrible that the majority of the scotus is slimy
moscow mitch creep
rep are nothing but confederate trash
i bet at least two justice made a large bundle off this vote
got ta give them crazy jesus bible thumpers due credit cause man can they get stuff done they been plotting and scheming and got it done unlike democrat who just lie out their buts about healthcare for all free tuition for public college maternity and paternity leave theyve done absolutely nothing
this is what happens when you elect a bunch of unqualified conservative judge to the highest court in the nation they cant even make basic decision about the law without letting their emotion opinion and the people that own them tell them what to do
corrupt clarence thomas need to go let start there
the supreme court is full of fraud
we are so proud of our democracy here in the u we shout our conviction that we live in the best country in the world when we look at the fact we see that our democracy is railroaded by neo conservative who weaponize the supreme court how can we allow a political party to own our freedom how can we allow them to hold up a legal nomination of a moderate justice so that he can be replaced with an ultra right politician i fought and bled for our country i thought but now i realize i lost my youth and my health for no reason but the political aim of a morally bankrupt president my country is sliding into third world status and nobody seems aware of it
the conservative supreme court with their black robe is a corrupt court
free american people need to rise up most other country in europe fight for their right and we need to do that
not exactly a bombshell she still voted to restrict abortion right to woman there nudging to think about shes the trump of scotus justice compared with the washington general of equality rbg
call it what it is a conspiracy of party on the supreme court that actively worked to overthrow settled law
we knew we saw it coming i hope the clerk who do actually have enormous sway over the right of u citizen will be vetted beyond their political attractiveness to leo federalist or heritage going forward congress could and should enact auditing or ig for scotus staff who are paid by tax dollar
he gave u moral absolute that are what our court system agree with do not murder dont steal etc it a crime punishable by law
and hope they do not decide your life is worthless too god bless
we decl care that all men are created equal and given inalienable right the right to life the right to liberty and the right to happiness by god
the supreme court consists of a christian conservative majority thanks to pressure from ex president trump and the christian right wing now making christian conservative decision and opinion a an atheist that doe not recognize the existence of the christian god yahwehjesus i find their ruling that overturned legal abortion irrelevant
what im hearing is the final decision on abortion wa made long before the court even heard the case
it doe not mean she is against repeal only it would look bad for her
other than robert the other 5 conservative justice are way more concerned with advancing conservative policy than being neutral arbiter of the constitution to them overturning roe v wade is the main reason why they were appointed that is what they truly believe wa their job description not to objectively interpret the constitution but to advance the conservative agenda a an attorney and someone who care deeply about the law i find that extremely sad i dont even care one way or the other about abortion i care about the constitution and what it mean to this great country stare decisis mean more to me than any particular substantive issue i get that if legal precedent is clearly erroneous it should be reversed a society becomes more enlightened and a certain past draconian view become obsoleteintolerable by society the court in brown v board of education wa right to overturn plessy v ferguson which by the way wa a 9 0 unanimous decision which indicates the prior decision in plessy wa clearly erroneous but ignoring stare decisis should never be used to go backward like in this case also ignoring stare decisis should only be done with a unanimous or near unanimous decision not a 63 split like in this case where the decision is made on partisan line
so constitution say judge serve based on good behavior so clarence thomas ha not behaved good so he could be impeached
scout is a breach of trust
clearance wife is the one who leak it
bombshell no new information just a bunch of speculation based on anonymous source that could easily not exist i wonder why reporter expect total trust when they have shown many time that they dont hesitate to lie ann misled based on political economical and social inclination by the way i respect kamtors tone it doe not seems she is trying to blow the stuff out of proportion or building a narrative
the supreme court may think they are the bos but they arent everyday go bye they show their backside in the wind but the day is coming when they will be swept aside with the other trash the good lord will reign their unjust way will be no more
direct descendant of spanish inquisition
it wa nothing more than pushing a religous agenda that is all it ever wa and they have tried to overturn it for year but did not have the majority to do it this is why the gop wanted trump in
the first thing i want is for men to shut up your vote came when you impregnated the woman who is in charge of childbirth the last thing i want is a woman to have a child who doe not want a child any question
no wonder we stopped hearing about the leak it went from being a travesty against america to oh well once it became undeniable that it wa a conservative who leaked it
sad our highest court is owned
person 1 doe backflip person 2 who cant do backflips we should ban backflips lol america in a nut shell
who want to bet the leak wa justice alito again and theyll blame it on a staffer
im thinking once biden win his second term he will add judge we need to make our scotus liberal bc the definition of being liberal is accepting and understanding all being republican mean you will judge and rule based on your religion not for all american
the court decision wa based on religious view not the right of woman
who care if barrett wa hesitant in the end she did what she wa picked to do take right away from woman
superb work great article i believe alito lied and leaked so he could lock in the vote he knew he had risk of losing
the leak came from the gop appointed judge
this logic concerning ruth and justice waiting for her death doe not make sense she wa not a legaly valid justice some time before her death requires siting for the bench not at home where no one actualy knowes if it really even her vote
amazing how they think more baby are going to be born i see more birth control being used
alito leaked it clearly
so basically it wa not a legal decision they had already made up their mind and just wanted it to come before them so they could essentially stomp on it disgusting i dont know how anyone could ever trust the supreme court ever again
they are all racist crook
how could 51 of u citizen not feel that scotus is a breech of constitutional trust
personally i believe that originalism in constitutional interpretation is a uninformed hermeneutically a fundamentalism is in islamic jewish and christian doctrine each is more about personal certainty and power than it is about genuine interaction with a text
congratulation america you have a corrupt supreme court
the justice should be disbanded for dishonest behavior and bribery
the conservative supreme court is a threat to american democracy now that theyve been overturned roe v wade theyre coming for voting right and then theyre going to come for interracial marriage just you wait the evangelicals wont stop until we are living in a religious theocracy just like iran
notice alito is the only one not looking at the camera weird
anybody know who the scotus member are
wow another overhyped nothing burger of a report from msnbc
sam seder called it when it happened
i would say vote blue but the dems are ok with anything thats technically legal and will bend over backwards to reach across the isle no matter how many american the republican harm
ban abortion
scotis ha 6 greedy corrupt lying judge i hate those 6 judge with all my soul
thomas wife wa the leak duh i knew this within second of hearing happen it is so painfully obvious
the right organizes there is a deep state of rightwing activist who have planned an end to abortion for decade planned it while the left talked about bipartisanship and reached across the aisle it would be nice if the left recognized that it in a fight between an open inclusive society and christofascism
is anyone surprised that kavanaugh would lie and deceivecompletely consistent with his confirmation testimony
the damage is done it always the people who suffer from currupt decision which is politically all day every day what say c and his besti please
prison cell for trump putin clarence and rudy 2024
since when under our constitution doe the sc make law oh since we have the robertstrump court they dont believe in our constitution nor follow their 1 job is to destroy it for a trump dictatorship
the overturning of roe v wade wa entirely politically and self serving to maintain profit the corporation need worker and consumer handmaiden tale ha some truth to it
law made by men or woman cant last forever just like the men and woman that enact them
politics and power no the politics and power grab involved the original 1970s roe v wade scotus decision the issue belongs with the state period there a big flippin reason this is the united state of america and not the all seeing all knowing know whats best for everyone big daddy switchwielding federal government
they have got make sure thier anti christ is born
and this change nothing
honestly most surprised that a woman and a black man did that to their own
stutter sputter cant they get a guy that can speak well
from day one of the death of rbg i did not trust that she died of her cancer my information at that time wa that she wa just getting better after some therapy at the same time all medium discussed russian interference in u election without identifying any action of them specifically her death came last second for a new nomination by trump and a possible elector boost that wa just too convenient to a possible interference with infamous russian poisoning my mind made this all up and i wondered that apparently nobody else considered it then again i also saw january 6 coming before most other people anyway i remain in my belief and would appreciate if someone could give me factual information which could change my belief
this is all just noise doesnt matter rvw is overturned
the supreme court wa never supposed to be partisan we need to impeach criminal in the scoutus
it broken the u supreme court no politician shoud apoint a judge other judge do that else it not divided and not free of politics thats what a normal democrcy work in the 3 branch like it surposed to be
they are garbage
stupidity reign supreme in america
the supreme court lost all respect from the people of america
isnt it great that a reporter will dig for news but wont give source no one will trust me again if i tell who it wa so i am guessing the reporter just like the judge president ex predidents senator congress person put their career above the people in this case mostly woman the life of the people of the usa
i do not understand how this supreme court think they have the right to stop a woman or anybody else from murdering a child it your child and you should have the choice to murder your child what a bunch of sickos in this world
amy ha not real opinion nor doe she have the skill needed to be on the court she wa picked just to vote with the boy she is a traitor to woman feel sorry for her child especially her daughter
vile bunch in that thumbnail vile lying and evil
woman are not property anymore get the court to prove that definition it sound like woman are still being oppressed it need to stop
this issue should never have been a court issue in the first place never out of the doctor office and patient but there were billion to be made for the agenda it only went back to the state 10th amendment it wa about money from the get go not health not woman but power and money
judge should not be political only interpret
even ginsburg said rowe wasnt a valid ruling it just pass it back to the state
now that weve seen the sadistic consequence of overturning roe wa it worth dividing the nation by your dogmatic decision
congress not the supreme court needed and still need to make the proper law codifying the right to abortion and specifying the limit and rule that are or are not needed in this interview she talk about them considering a 15 week rule and such thats not their job they are supposed to interpret the existing law congress need to do their job a usual
this is the best court the republican party could buy
robert breach of trust is a good way to put it but who trust are you saying the american people trust the court anymore
no wonder they gave the green light for police to lie a they did the same during their senate interview how much doe it cost for a vote a we now know at least some of them can be bought on vacation
the corruption and greed of clarence thomas are blatant and obvious he put his gavel on sale to the highest bidder this is illegal he ha betrayed the trust of every citizen and he deserves to be prosecuted and held accountable for destroying the trust the world had for the highest court in america vote blue save america
to think i have respected the supreme court ruling most my life now i am not even sure if they care how rule affect the people of our country it make me very sad for this country and the future of this nation
the protestant were right to fear a papist court when kennedy won the presidency the republicanappointed are all on the take and antiamerican po they follow pius xii who thought hitler final solution wa a swell idea they even have their own blöd führer in trump name religion appt by john robert chief justice catholicism g w bush clarence thomas catholicism g h w bush samuel alito catholicism g w bush neil gorsuch anglicanismcatholicism trump brett kavanaugh catholicism trump amy coney barrett catholicism trump sonia sotomayor catholicism obama elena kagan judaism obama ketanji brown jackson protestantism
the new face of evil in this country
is being a supreme court justice about scholarship anymore this is why people are foregoing university they dont want to become sophist like these people
i think what we need is more old white guy in the supreme court ugh
neither kamala nor any of the other proabortionists can answer when a fetus is considered another human being
stop political appointment for the supreme court vet canidates then use a lottery system to choose the canidate remove the politics and the allegiance required for the nomination these people should be non political and only there for one thing to interpret the law without bias
i just wonder do they ever go to bed at night thinking how their sc will be remembered in history a one of the most corrupted sc in united state history they are the worst of the worst of human even if they dont believe they are the world know they are
this lady is too close in take a step back barret had within a matter of month declared that roe wa settled law in front of the entire country she wa hoping to put distance between her and the lie before shed have to admit it wa a lie once the cat wa out of the bag she voted exactly how she wa intended to vote all along aint no mystery just an attempt to save face i think the leak wa a good thing it forced their hand in time to cost them every election since and it going to continue to cost them every election purple state are going to turn blue over this one and red state are going to turn purple we already know what the woman of ohio think of it will be interesting to see what the woman of texas will do with their own personal gilead
republican nothing like having your own court
u scotus is the new world clown show when thing start going down hill it run away from you pretty quick far quicker than you guy and gal figured ya well some of you at least now how long will it be an embarrassment to be a scotus justice i think they are responsible for that my guess is it will be for some time
the supreme court is not an abortion scrotus rule ok and can someone stop judging amy the kicker hows this for a fun fact roe not her real name is a born again christian now and doesnt believe in abortion oh america youve done it again
we know who did it and so do they there is not process for investigating these black robe
tldr it wa alito obviously
oh really you dont say now that you see the real cost it costing your party you are scrambling to do something abt it shame on you you liers and thief
their garbage i used to respect scotus more than anything but i say there at least 4 that need to be impeached have great reason to back it up their disgusting also whats the value in doing anything a far a state right if scotus can just come right behind with this knucklehead group that lie under oath undo everything youve done
we do not believe them in the supreme court nor do we trust them barrett lied kavanaugh lied and i dont even know what to say about thomas i wish we would get more supreme court justice that are fair and follow the constitution
yes supreme court bought paid for corrupt judge bought and paid for by billionaire and instated on court by trump so of course this corrupt government will rule for trump we have no justice in america
yeah but he definitelyhad to getelectedsooohowsthat working for you not so good huh wellthats exactly what happenswhen youcheat
state can do what they want no one stopping them
wellonce we gain powerover boththe senate and the house of representativesall will beok
wa this really four day old or an attempt to keep abortion top of mind for the election
why is she making excuse this is the problem people need to stop soft peddling this nonsense and just call it a it is conservative republican did what they said they were going to do there wa no nuanced discussion or debate on abortion
thats exactly what they did and they wonder why the american people see them the way they do because thats who they are
when that putrid curtain is pulled back thats behind the supreme court it gon na show a scared little orange man just like in the wizard of oz all these people have been like the flying monkey and melania will melt
the abndonment of reason and logical rationality in such high legal decieons and replaced by political manouver mean the ussupreme court is no longer a defender of legal right and truth it is a buyable political agent of others it ha undermined it high role and besmirched itself badly it ha also galvanised huge number of woemn who are very angry at this intrusion into their personal liberty
reporting is disingenuous barrett did not switch side she merely acted to withhold fact from the american people
omg i thought that wa a guy
when doe a law become a crime cruel and unusual punishment prohibition stated in state constitution medical privacy between licenced medical proffessional provider and patient and legitament decision pregnacies and medical risk are not created equal and one size fit all ban or law of an abstract ideology can not be regulated and force non medical and political interference political malpractice and medical imposter do not protect anyone
so now we are giving acb credit for being reasonable really all she did wa play hardball in a futile attempt to avoid being vilified for the rest of her life a a republican political patsybut we all know thats exactly what she is otherwise her monumentally hypocritical appointment in the last day of a failed republican presidency wouldnt have happened in the first place she deserves credit for being politically savvynot for being reasoned and impartial her placement on the court is a corrupt and illegitimate a kavanagh and gorsuch even if she didnt exactly lie under oath a they did she prevaricated better than they did because she is smarter than they are so call her what she is an extreme maga political activist who will go down in history a a traitor to woman and a lynchpin of the movement to destroy american democracy because let face itwomen are the canary in the coal mine anywhere and any time authoritarianism is on the rise gim me a break
one major problem we the people have euh we do not have enuff n word a judge on the scotus especially female n word
a known billionaire is sucking up to these republican and they all know that eventually they will be rewarded for their action in helping the ultra right wing dangerous moron not directly a they know they can be traced but it will happenone along with his wife is already getting a lot of money just because he threatened to leave this phony court and be replaced by a democratits a strange justice department this highest court filled with quid pro quo people all on the right
if they want to complain about a breach of trust perhaps they should look at themselves and how the american people can not trust them it time to change thing up in that old lying supreme court
how can a sc nominee tell congress on their confirmation say rvw is settled law then turn around and and say rvw is unconstitutional say a lot about lying justice and a lazy congress
let me guess it wa trump fault in the end
there no bombshell it just a stupid who caresshell
gosh i thought that corruption wa endemic only in african country
nevermind the fact that roe wa decided far too broadly roe ventured too far in the change it ordered and presented an incomplete justification for it action rbg
this edition of the supreme court is an abortion a legal abortion stare decisis be damned
i wonder who could have possibly leaked this opinion schmarence schmomas we first heard about how scotus planned to rule in a leak from congress hateful eight everyone also know which justice ha the strongest or at least the most obvious tie to maga
ginsburg did the country a disservice by not retiring when a democrat wa in the white house
so why those justice can lie during confirmation and ha no consequence
thank you to the new york time
the breach of trust wa them lying in their questioning at their vote to be a judge
the coloured judge let all coloured people down by being absolutely brainless
robert wa so interested in investigating the leak and then nothing he found the leak and didnt want admit it wa a conservative justice or staffer
robert wa so interested in investigating the leak and then nothing he found the leak and didnt want admit it wa a conservative justice or staffer
the way i see it a few of the scotus lied under oath and set precedent for all to be able to lie under oath and face no consequence
she wa a worthless guest she gave no meaningful information
such a surprise that kavanaugh is playing fast and loose with his role said nobody
msnbc i continue to wish you were better news speaks for itself let influencers pretend the public need to be emotionally charged to click on their video bombshell is opinion the story is real let it be when you stop sucking ill tune in
this is the most corrupt classless sc weve ever had
jodi kanter seems to be trying very hard to make the story about barretts decision but im with chris hayes here the real story is that they tried to do this a quickly a possible after rgbs death while trying very hard to make it look like they werent
lester holt can you answer viveks question why did you lie to america why are you fake news vivek exposed msnbc and it ha yet to defend itself from the allegation
judge dy and then they over turn roe v wade there a movie they killed the judge they may want to watch the pelican brief
msnbc is the enemy of america
gee ya suppose gini thomas had anything to do with that leak
oh it wa settled alright shouldve dug a little deeper and asked them to explain more classic doublespeak
i dont care about the leak i care about the decision to overturn roe v wade
you forgot to mention that justice ginsberg supported the relitigation of roe because it wa flawed and wa not decided on the text of the constitution that wa obviously true a many other recognized legal and constitutional expert had said the same thing for many year and decade there is a strong case to be made that the issue should be legislated by congress and not 9 member of the court but congress ha still not passed a law on making abortion legal which show that roe wa not settled law why doesnt the legislature carry out their constutional role and responsibility to pas a law this ha caused a great deal of public unrest since roe wa decided
so ive noticed something all these people were worried about how they would look but no one even considered how it would affect people
alito is the chief person of interest hand down i like many american have lost confidence in the scotus ive always believed the scotus wa concerned about protecting the right of our citizen sadly im no longer of that opinion
why is it saying this is 3 day old
there wa never a right to abortion there wa a right to privacy on the issue of abortion that wa what roe decided in another case the court decided to limit abortion on viable fetus now they changed their mind protecting a baby life is indeed a function of the government and overruled roe bottom line the liberal did it to themselves they just had to have later and later abortion for perfectly viable baby then baby born alive then murdered on the operating table then harvesting organ despicable act after despicable act from abortion provider wa the straw that broke the proverbial camel back
what happened to the supreme court not being antiamerican the breach of trust is the fact that the supreme court ha been guilty of openly attacking american 247365 since the decision to abolish roe wa announced the leaker is the only person involved not guilty of attacking the american people
about barrett no it doesnt there is nothing profound or fascinating
regardless of the excuse given the reality is that this extremely conservative supreme court is poised to deprive woman in this country of their inherent right under the u constitution this supreme court ha unequivocally shown itself to be deeply corrupt willfully negligent and a threat to the nation period when the highest court in the land engages in bribery and attempt to selfregulate it own corrupt ethic the entire country will inevitably face the resultant consequence
the most corrupt branch of government
dred scott wa once considered settled law it horrible they overturned rvw but nobody should consider any decision irreversible especially now that dobbs is on the book
there is gun control with gun control nobody blame the target so men have the bullet sperm yet woman are controlled by said bulletgun holder
they fined the doctor that performed an abortion on a 10 year old rpe victim one of the politician even going a far a to say she should have been forced to give birth are you really surprised if that wa your daughter would you force her to have the child would you stay home to care for the newborn a the 11 year old mother repeat 5th grade
republican thought overturning roe would help them win election they were very wrong about that
so who leaked it
playing with america based on their affiliation to the gop party without the leak and this investigative reporting after the mess we now see that someone interfered all along so my remedy is to replace every justice that trump appointed since it wa illegal how he got into office and why he sitting in a courtroom today if the founder of the constitution didnt see this crap happening then we need to amend the constitution to crosscorrect these corrupt individual we have to put america back on track for the people not these politician or careerdriven people like george santos and clarence thomas are great example
it intellectually disingenuous to say that news of a deliberation lock you into a position you werent already locked into i highly doubt the leak cemented anyones position
old racist white supremacist judge are totally ignorant and do not care about the reality of a woman who doe not want to raise a child 18 year without financial support from the father just because of a one night stand of 5 minute they are bastardized in their 1950 view that all woman seeking an abortion are happily married and have money to care for a baby no womenteenagers have unwanted pregnancy because there are no woman clinic for low income woman to get birth control this cause a strain on foster home the adoption legal fee are 3050000
in people eye god always show mercy to the repentant soul
the other sometimes a unremorsefull person being served justice
i dont understand why it a problem that the trust of conservative sc justice ha been breached when you consider that theyve lied to u about their intention to not overturn roe v wade and theyve violated ethic standard like taking bribe from people whose case theyre presiding over the sc tried to hide the decision from the public and the leak breached their trust no our trust in the conservative justice ha been breached egregiously
the u doesnt want to do anything to protect their kid from getting shot at school so theyll just replace them with unwanted child great job
rgbs legacy will always be colored for me by her inability to make the choice to step down during obamas last term and keep u from being in this situation
lester holt us bombshell a often i use hi he sure can read a teleprompter he read the 48 hour script a if he were doing the nightly news same writer i bet
what a disgraceful scotus
msm bombshell are hilarious
so most likely it wa a republican that leaked
why arent more people talking about this new part of the story
imagine being so overly fair that you ignore and obfuscate the blatant truth it wa done for political reason there wa no oh well this make it look like it wa possibly done for political reason are you stupid or scared because it like saying the earth could be round
the vote against roe v wade were planned from the start thats why this wa kept hidden not because of this woman fantasy that maybe the conservative would have voted against conservatism if theyd just been allowed to do their secret process in peace it insulting to all the people affected by the court behavior to say that these judge might have done anything but stick to their plan
all of this being said will the right of a woman to control her own body in the united state of america
the shady six are not law scholar theyre far right political activist holding two stolen seat hostage
huh hows that investigation going will there be a report anytime soon it been well over a year now or did they not like the answer
barretts gesture to vote to not take the case wa just empty theatre she knew a well a anyone they had the vote to take it without her it give her the opportunity to say that she did the right thing she didnt recuse herself when they ended up taking it
there wa a big foardian slip right ther
we need better ethic oversight of the court
all of them are liers
say anything about it you want everyone know that it wa a progressive person who leaked it hoping they could force them to change their decision and somehow you act like this is perfectly fine show everyone how little character this network ha
every headline ha to have bombshell shocking blast in it constant violent imagery so american
scotus is corrupt
the supreme court want u to respect them and trust them ruth bader ginsburg is in my opinion the last of her kind they waited until she passed away and then spit and peed all over her grave by overturning roe v wade sowere those lavish gift that non of u could dream of affording kickback or bribe im sure they were both so now here we are and they expect u to trust them with the integrity of democracy and the constitution you say it wa only one supreme court judge that accepted these gift for ruling or wa her just the one who got caught the people are watching
abolish human abortion
republican are the american version of the taliban woman are thing
all of this come down to the 2016 election and mcconnell blocking merrick garland had hrc just won this wouldnt be a thing hillary cost the country roe i hope she realizes that her utter failure a a candidate ha had a decade long negative impact to the country
what i dont understand is why the democrat dont apply the law to the supreme court justice we know for a fact there is no doubt that these people lied to the united state congress in order to get these position the law say if they lie to the united state senate and house of representative that they have committed perjury and they should be impeached
the fact that they are appointed by the politician mean they are political all supreme court appointee should be hired and fired by their peer
it mean nothing i hate that reporter try to romanticize this stuff they wanted to overturn it so they did thats it thats all it wa a 40 year long game they played and we let them win im still side eyeing rbg because she should have retired when a dem wa president but she put her stock in hillary and this is where we are
at what point are enough white people without so much money hurt enough that they get fed up with this corrupt court and the corrupt gop
an investigative reporter think publican can be swayed i think she need to go continue investigating
obama failed when he rolledover on his nomination justice ginsberg failed to retire at an appropriate time
you mean the supreme potus did something inappropriate and ethical so what
how sad is the legal profession a a whole when member of the supreme court are proven liar just pathetic
inappropriate and intended to interfere in the process just when justice breyer wa considering joining the liberal 15 week ban this strengthens my point that justice alito wa responsible for the leak it cemented the vote to alitos advantage
the reason democracy is difficult though is that there is so much corruption here that occurs with the votingand it open every single one of you up to coupssoi would get a feel from what a country need and make sure their people like it and put them in therealso some region need much stronger staying power in term of leadership to prevent war and couping and conflictso for those region like the middle east i would have a different approachfor their own good it not about oppressing their people it about securing their security so we dont everyone attacking and going after one another like it a hobby i really hate ongoing war it horrific this place doesnt spin on suffering the suffering and rampant abuse must stop it must stop universal income is the quickest way to do that no social score just give it out flat 3500 month to everyone on the planet take away from those with over a billion a no one need that much and redistribute it not that hard we start there
why are these sc judge appointed for life
they the court w a super theocratic fascist majority representation of in just the court represents the minority in of the american public opinion this is the virtual end of trust in the sc
on the supreme court dobbs leak many of u floated the he who smelt it dealt it theory that alito mightve done it himself and the fact that scotus dropped the investigation advocated by people who said the leak destroyed the court and none of them have objected add to that
why are we paying more attention to the leak than we are to the fact that kavanaugh and barrett both said that roe wa settled law and they wouldnt overturn it they lied how can you trust the integrity of a sc justice that lie to get their job
what doe barretts not wanting to take the casebut still voting with the majoritymean it mean that far from giving a crap about the law she care only about her own optic and she wanted to pretend in line with her and kavanaughs and gosuchs fake senate testimony that she considered roe settled law that she wa objective on the issue
from this i draw the conclusion that scotus had already come to a decision before hearing the fact in effect the justice were governing rather than arbitrating clearly the scotus need to be saddled with the sjotus supreme jury of the united state to prevent them from governing and restrict them to arbitration
the supreme court ha a problem their name i believe it ha gone to their head they need more defined rule and term limit and i never understood why ruth didnt step down maybe supreme went to her head
the confirmation hearing are a joke what is the legal purpose of the confirmation hearing if the nominated and approved judge can not be held accountable to their sworn statement
breach of trust funny coming from rightwing member of scotus
that branch of government is disgraceful zero ethic and zero accountability
so politically speaking the three level of government are the house the senate and the supreme court thats what happens when law take a back seat to politics
scotus the highest judge money can buy
the leak show the deceiving
they waited for ruth to die no woman is safe with those judge
what are msnbc cnn and other left wing outlet trying to do to our country the roe law wa sent back to the state for people to vote on rather than have the federal govt telling u what to do the left still believe in korematsu v united state 1944 and other destruction of civil liberty like dei why is it that the left want to have the federal govt dictate our life i believe in freedom not fascism
possibly the last sitting supreme court it no wonder this country turned naxi
no surprise here
need baby for the army
50 states50 country get over it libs
amy worried she might get become a pawn but she is clearly a crazy god extremist person she belief in santa too
you guy failed to mention that if it werent for mitch mcconnell changing the rule this never would have happened republican cheat to win
tired of men making choice about our body health reproduction
another bombshell headline just reporting the news not being hyperbolic and hackneyed
what i also find concerning is that the anti abortion justice make a decision against abortion before debate and thoughtful consideration of the will of the public in the end it clearly is a political decision
im appalled among many many others across the civilised world at aspect of this whole issue and how it is dealt with in your country on both side of it first of all the way woman in favour of it a a necessary part of certain aspect of woman improved medical care and also choice of whether they should be pregnant or not in often very appalling circumstance are pirtrayed and behave with frankly ottcheering etc undignifies and trivialises the whole scenario it doe wo m en no service bbc whatsoeveralso the business of the unbalanced political bias of scotus which defies commmon sense surely it should always be a balanced set up especially a the appointment are for life how is this never sorted out mass public hysteria seems to rule the roost across the justice board on so many issue that require clear non emotiional response at every level deplorable all round
the supreme court is corrupt and owned by the super wealthy and maga republican term limit for the corrupt court six year limit and can not run again
they already made the decision amongst themselves to overturn rvw before they case wa before the court that is proof that the court is corrupt and the judge involved in overturning rvw should be impeached and disbarred and most likely criminally charged with conspiracy and corruption they already sold their vote and accepted bribe but congress will defend the american people from these criminal this is what the criminal in congress wanted and they support these criminal on the bench
republican rat
216 it may look that this is about politics and power whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat it may they are appointed by politician who listen to lobbyist it all political
155 lol the passing of justice help refresh the law like 4 time a century
jive bull crap trump is trying to be dictator of the greatest democratic government ever the reick publicant party is dead
iti is their body you selfrighteous fool have no say if we wat to be controlled by ignorance fear we will go to a church of our choice dose not belong in government
the ignorance of most of the lefty reply is breathtaking
scotus is corrupt and illegitimate until all that lied during their confirmation hearing are removed from the bench
dont count on these trump shill to hold the line when it come to putting the orange cancer in prison
justice robert do your job alito and his three stooge and both thomas are liar and cheater taking our right away and country backwards church and state must be separate once and for all or tax church now
barrett is the same backstabbing gal a in the show ozark
imagine taking away right and and the people that are always saying their right are being taken away cheer for it
the female justice are the only one with any backbone and moral
if the gallows sat outside each home of scotus maybe then they would stop leaning over to the side of white isi maga if youre reminded every day of what your blind support of maga will bring
it not exactly a bombshell if it is so predictable
when a document that wa going to be released anyway get leaked this is a breach of trust we must investigate when clarence thomas ha been accepting very expensive gift from a mein kampfloving billionaire for many year cricket
root out the federalist supreme court justice we will never have a balanced court with them on the bench in addition there have been for example so many time when clarence thomas should have recused himself when having a conflict of interest and he did not they operate at their own will and ideology and even if we are able to purge trrump we will still have remnant of his appointee left making the ruling to give lifetime appointment seems not the way to go because you get stuck in their ideological rigidity and resistance
today supreme court doe not represent even 0000001 percent of the american people it is no more than a political cult a right wing political cult elected by le than 1 of temporary and career politician who are also on their way to become billionaire through mysterious mean
whoever the leaker is need to be charged
im sorry but i dont buy that the leak cemented a position thats a very convenient excuse but the deliberative process can not change bad faith the second the u sc decided to relitigate a closed decision with 85 public support they lost all credibility and to say the leak forced u to double down is like saying well it ok that my kid lied to my face i busted them and maybe theyd have changed their mind and come clean why are we expecting honesty from the corrupt
thomas is a crooked crimal and he should not cover cing any thing
theyre a bunch of corrupt rightwing liar in this court
blah blah blah decision wa reversed deal with it
this is what you get for keeping unencrypted memo laying around on their window 10 desktop they make for great influence tool to use especially when you hack the judge by weaponizing their individual belief against them to plant a trojan
the last 3 scj should be removed they lied to get the job
all these old corrupt people deciding a woman right is fricken nut non are without sin
isnt it pritty disturbing to think the highest court in the land cant be trusted
ive heard this journalist on npr and now msnbc im left more irritated each time it appears a if shes suggesting the leak potentially caused this outcome or that the justice had no other choice but to stop negotiating can we do a deeper dive and ask why they took up this case in the first place what superficial and lazy investigating blaming the leak even suggesting it for their ultimate choice give me a break
term limit and appointed by national popular vote of 60 or better a president should still be allowed to appoint these judge but the nation should be allowed the final vote it wrong that a tiny handful of individual are allowed to determine national law for all they effectively have more power than any other branch of government a well a the populace it creates an institution dedicated to upholding corruption
it will come out that one of conservative justice leaked the case themselves to cement the vote against roe however i have lost all confidence in scotus
get your sport equipment armor and face paint ready the man made apocalypse is coming
this is what happens when dems take their eye off the ball on the long game biden is up for reelection and the team is wringing their hand about him when they know the alternative will be trump show up and vote or see what else you lose
supreme clown court impeach thomas and the three clown that lied under oath saying they wouldnt over turn roe v wade
i have even le respect for barrett now she care even more about political optic than taking away woman right wow
everyone know it wa one of the left wing justice
if trump never got elected none of this b would never have happened disgusting
robert call a breach of trust the whole supreme court ha been a breach of trust to the american people
refuse for what she knew what her opinion wa going to be sound like grandstanding to me
conservative is now the most disgusting word in english language
it simpler than all this trump stacked the court case closed it all go back to the vote
it wa ginni thomas and it wa deliberate
these people clearly bad why are they elected for life that is insane we all know now anita hill wa right and thomas is a freak then you got lying amy and black face judge really laughable
clarginia thomas do the right thing and recuse
end of an empire corruption at our supreme court
to the supreme court
why would it be ok for the justice to discus case outside of deliberation when juror are told to never do that while a matter wa pending
i dont get it you have more gun in the usa than citizen men woman and child yet no one is prepared to take arm against a sea of trouble
this is appalling is there no branch of government with honor and integrity
sc supremely corrupt robert ha sold the u democracy to the highest bidder with citizen united and sat around knowing all the while his colleague are taking bribe from billionaire he should be tried for treason and corruption it only a matter of time before we find out what he been taking under the table and his false indignation is sickening
happened so methodically that i i even suggested on fb that could justice g death have been hastened it enough that thomas is still on the bench a crooked greedy and bought that he is scotus is sadly political and sloppy i cant respect it anymore
yes there the root cause of all our problem they fail to understand that abortion is a medical procedure they fail to understand what privacy is they all collect a paycheck on violating our right if you american soldier were telling the truth about protecting u you do something about them now
ok im gon na guess that alito leaked the draft opinion and that the republican justice were all in on overturning roe v wade and were searching around for a vehicle to do it now im going to listen to the clip
this is why other country no longer look up to the u a a role model it politics ha become trash
they are all deceitful duplicitous disingenuous and despicable
hopefully the democrat can take power in congress then they can draft a bill that make supreme court justice accountable a other nonjustices are what applies to normal judge should apply to supreme court justice it should include that any supreme court justice found to be corrupt will automatically be removed from his position and indicted for corruption and have a minimum mandatory jail term of 10 year with asset ceased in remuneration of their corruption
there wa a good chance that rgb would have voted to overturn it anyway she wa on record saying she would have never voted in favor of roe and she thought it wa a bad ruling
wa alito or someone affiliated with him the leaker
the leak wa only inappropriate when they got caught
in canada there is a requirement that all judge at whatever level must retire at age 75 that may not be the right age perhaps could be older but it make for way more rejuvenation of the judiciary that in the u where judge whether liberal or conservative can hang on until they become a bit senile that result in a much le politically perceived judiciary than in the u
why are those for abortion parent didnt believe in abortion at least in their case
trump found three judge willing to lie under oath
in what imagination of the universe is it correct for the minority to dictate the right of the majority
who else wa thinking jodie wa a dude till she started talking
were they waiting till she died
a puff piece on justice barrett wow why i am going to say this is allegedly the truth allegedly
get these judge out of my doctor office get this government out of my pharmacy
kavanagh and others during their confirmation hearing all said that roe v wade wa settled law and that that wa that turn out they were all full of crap
abortion leak im sorry that sound terrible
the breach of trust wa the supreme court overturning roe v wade itself like excuse me
to me the most obvious and important point that is constantly overlooked is how blatantly the last 3 justice flatout lied to congress they all swore that they had no predetermined intent to overturn roe swore up and down that if given the case they would make their decision solely on the case presented they all gave this impression under oath to congress if lying to congress to get past the required screening process so you can do exactly what you truly were intent on doing if that isnt an impeachable offense i cant imagine what else would be then there the other two prizewinners clearly in the pocket of rich special interest that they then sit in judgement on case involving them how is this not impeachable im not pointing a finger at them because they are on one particular political party or the other only in that their action are at minimum a disgrace to the office of supreme court supreme suggests that these should be the bestofthebest turn out their just corrupt politician just like the rest
get the government out of my doctor office
so much for believing in the court ever again christian value brought in
this just go to show you how critical election are never skip voting if you dont use that privilege you will lose it and you will find you are living under a government that doesnt respect the ideal of the people or the constitution in fact you may not even ever get the opportunity to vote again vote prodemocracy and that mean at present vote for democrat
abort the court
wa it a death or a murder im perceiving the latter
we all know the drunk judge kavanaugh is a liar why do we have to have a drunk judge anyway i always wondered about that arent there some sober judge around i have no problem with drunk a long a their not making decision that effect my life
i just want to ask dont republican have or had abortion thank you
i suppose the next thing to bring woman under control is to send them to jail to protect them from gender based violence like the taliban is doing in afghanistan
who said trump never got anything done
this is a pointless story once they made their ruling we knew how they felt
msnbc this story would be much easier to understand if they would quit using future tense while talking about the past what happens next mean it hasnt happened yet other time they were using presenttense verb that is confusing and i am well educated if this usage is mildly momentarily distracting to me it will likely make it hard for others to understand at all use past tense verb please
bruh she is placing blame on the leak instead of allowing supreme court justice of the united state to be accountable adult
dont we have a system or check and balance why arent these judge being punished
i think it is political thomas need to be kicked off the court he is a crook kavanaugh is a liar and a po these men need to have their viagra taken away
thank god i cant get pregnant good luck woman but seriously if that old bat wouldve retired year ago this wouldnt be an issue
more national enquirer reporting from msnbc time waisted here
abortion is murder and need to be banned
isnt the removal of roe v wade a breach of trust a well
bottom line all is that all of them need to be removed from the court totally corrupt court without doubt
here the thing it ha become obvious that these supreme court justice have their finger in many pie the corruption of quite a few of them ha become public knowledge after this piece of information regarding roe v wade ha now been revealed it is my opinion that the public trust ha been even more damaged and possibly irrevocably so at least for these far right justice with that in mind i would think all of these justice should be painfully aware that their decision on whether trump or anyone else for that matter including themselves is above the law their corrupt action may have hidden for decade but the truth will always out should trump be gifted with the title above the law and he get back into the oval office he will inevitable proclaim himself monarchking and with complete power have the ability to denouncedisband scotus if not for their redundancy alone then for their action in dismissing his case or their decision on ruling against him then they will have no cover at all against trump vindictive hateful destructive decision for him throwing the judicial system into utter chaos would be just another day at the golf course for him beware the easy path inclination become slippery slope that may lead to hungry alligator in a pit at the bottom
decision about reproduction should be made by people of reproductive age
this report is the first time i have heard why a supreme court leak is important and yet it importance had to be stressed by jodi kantor granted chris hayes already get it but for the rest of u i am thankful jodi kantor emphasized that a supreme court leak make it very difficult for any of the justice to change how they would decide a i understand this during the deliberation process of the justice a they tentatively state their position assuming they will still be able to change their ultimate decision an insider may leak an interim point wherein the leaker desired outcome would be met if this interim point were the final decision thus by leaking this interim point the leaker make it very difficult for any of the justice to change their interim position when making their final decision
dear supreme court human biology and best medical practice dont differ state to state your dobbs decision wa ignorant and arrogant
liar liar robe on fire
why are they doing this again with election around the corner this is definitely done on purpose
may i introduce mr thomas
none of this corrupt supreme court people care about the people they just want to get all the bribe they can what a nerve garbage
they are horrible
corrupt leader trump corrupt adjudicator courtesy of trump religion taking control of our democracy stop the madness in congress remove the corruption from among the controller in scotus doesnt this make sense
this is no longer the land of the free now is the land ruled by the religionist cruel politician
ok so id anyone going to be held accountable i feel like these people talk in riddle is anyone going to jail or not
a politically appointed body with exceptional power no accountability and no oversight what bunch of moron thought this wa a good idea
abortion is with the state where it belongs
lol it can look like politics and power instead of legal reasoning yeah no duh amy youre an illegitimate court
the least legitimate least informed least morale supreme court in several generation of the united state of america it shameful hope robert is proud of his legacy leading the worst most corrupt court perhaps in history
lol john robert breach of trust comment is absurd given it turned out to be a real trickster move and given the time john robert ha breached trust with the american people such a citizen united and rowe v wade
one of the great mistake of this court this is what happens when the gop catch the car there were reason all the other court upheld roe v wade and they were wise enough to see what the fallout would be which show just how wise this present court is
term limit how do we do this
why on earth do judge on the scotus have lifetime power to shape america according to their own politics even a president can only serve 2 term it is plainly stupid and a the judge age they will lose contact with the change in culture that happen over decade the law should adapt to the time not live in the past
i think we need to ignore political line with this issue the first 40 year of my life i wa comfortably prochoice birth control ha come an extremely long way and option today make it very easy for the majority of people to never have an unwanted pregnancy minus risk to the mother or an extreme situation abortion in today day and age is just callous abortion is not birth control
yeah johnny is going to conduct a through and painstaking investigaton i have bridge to sell ya in arizona for five dollar
this discussion will ruin the gop a if trump wasnt enough american preferred gridlock
this guy lie twice in his reporthe said initially that they decided to take the case before rbg died then later say they decided month aftercant even make up his mind
i wonder how much the six made for selling out a woman right to body autonomy and health care fortunately the robert court will go down in history a corrupt
great job of reporting
what could possibly go wrong when the highest court in the land is compromised and corrupt
it funny that pro life people also complain about social aid if we dont have unwanted child in our society we wont have to spend a much on social aid we should encouraged and sometimes mandate this for certain group of people like chemically dependent people those on state aid and people who are here illegally
every judge is a politician in black rope exercising their bias and prejudice
this is all about politics this is about timing and after justice ruth bader ginsberg passing donald trump and republican moved very fast in getting their justice all in with overturning roe v wade i hope voter are seeing and understanding how donald trump and maga republican can basically take away our right the voting right sequence should hopefully be investigated a vote for donald trump is a vote for authoritarian dictatorship a vote for donald trump is a vote for supporting vladimir putin
this show what happens when a foreign entity catholic church dictatorship theology is allowed to run our democracy
look like someone did something really inappropriate trying to influence member of the court ya think
a lot of this mischief could be prevented in the future by a law or amendment deciding that scotus jurisprudence become part of the codex of law of the u and can not be reversed by scotus itself but only by a law of congress or an amendment to the constitution that would also diminish the political power of the court somewhat it would have made dobbs impossible if it had been in effect previously
the new ethical judicial behavioral code the supreme court wrote for themselves without any monitoring or enforcement apparatus is such garbage so incredibly bogus
the supreme court talking about a breach of trust is hilarious irony
free will
what i thought that they had already dismantled it
the only breach of trust is that from the supreme court i trust them zero
whooooo caaaares just agree and move on to overturning heller by the same wording on the ruling see you later heller
the supreme court should be the most transparent of all it is literally our last line of justice hiding thing is inappropriate it should be supremely fair open and right not secret and questionable people need to know why they are deciding the way they are everything should be based solely on the constitution and what the public want for the people by the people and of the people maybe we would be better off with ai deciding based on the constitution it wouldnt use feeling or belief to decide just fact it also couldnt be bought off
also good that msnbc is keeping this subject front and center it will cripple republican in 2024
supreme court a contradiction in term these people are a medieval throwback
no different than royalty in olde europe minute law and punishment for the peasant vague rule with little over sight for those up the candle
if thats true amy berret ha to be impeached and replaced by a real conservative justice
the supreme court is political five justice owe their appointment to the ultra conservative federalist society they are all a disgrace in so many way
barrett just wanted to delay the blowback of her lying in confirmation
did russia pay 24 million to a biden shelf company it russian collusion but hunter did end the gun debate bwahahahaha whata disfunctional family hunter sum up the presidency to a tee 1 big trip to the atm
the supreme court is all about partisan politics and evangelical christianity and let not forget about bribery from billionaire
sick party
why do people care if a stranger get an abortion or not like dude get a job a hobby anything lol
sound like damage control
it should be up to each woman if they want an abortion it their body their mind and their heart too take away someone right and free will is wrong what will be next band birth control for woman if you start taking away the free right to control your life then we will lose in time all free right to decide for ourselves we will be under a government rule state
i dont like opinion in the news fix it minion
abortion is going to happen legal or not keep the squrty end out
listen plz to the last thing she mention to me she almost reveals what judge make the leak 100 sure thge lkeak come from a judge that got scared of the 15 week ban that most of europe have but wanted roe overturned wanted the state to ban it i remember there wa accusation of leftist judge wa the one who leaked i bet to differ i would love to know more about this
what doe that abortion rule do for a woman first amendment or dont they have one
reason is there any reason on the court
the supreme court should have age and term limit
vote marianne williamson president 2024 give her a chance to debate
all you woman you got ta start really opening your mouth these idiot are trying to take out all woman right
breach of trust by robert
ending rvw wa a gift to the dems were riding the blue wave towards a super majority and finally some rational governance in the u t is the gift that keep on giving
supreme court justice should have term limit and so should senator and any other political entity 8 year and no more than 8 year for any one of them
get rid of the court
the more i think about it chief justice robert ha lost control of ghe supreme court and is no chief justice by any mean
it dangerous you gamble with one
no abortion is safe
it a matter of being more morally sound and accountable to prevent them alot of woman have died from botched abortion too most drs do them for money only
our democracy is already gone in this country the corruption of this supreme court is disgusting
why are people not trying to get birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancy
a breach of trust john robert just who do you think you can trust one thing is for sure _you_ are not trusted in fact your corrupt scotus is held in well deserved contempt
all i can say is men fighting so hard to keep woman pregnant is all we need to know and exactly why they have no business making medical and life decision for u
supreme court political ideological ghoul hard to believe a person could reached the pinnacle of judicial authority and not understand that judge are supposed to be unbiased by their own subjective leaning
chris hayes is a stuttering mess please msnbc invest in some speech class for him you could probably write it off on your tax
the woman right have to be respected
at this point of scous could we even believe the leak investigation they have shown their own ethic to be in question
what happened to separation of church and state shame on them all abortion is healthcare not up for debate by religious zealot
nice group portrait therethe judicial division of the republican party politicised and compromised
christian are destroying america
we need to have term limit for supreme court justice in my personal opinion we should have never given lifetime term for any of our government position with such power and magnitude over the people of our nation duh
the ruling is that it is up to each individual state
woman in texas and oklahoma now live under the same religious law a woman in syria and libya the gop want all american woman to live and die under those same law
it must be very hard for every woman to have an abortion a decision that will have the effect of a lifetime but is wa her own right to do to find peace and the power to continue
justice are politician toocorrupted politician you dont change the devil the devil change you money and favor grant access and access influence policy internal accountability is not possible
the question is they all said at their conformation that they wouldnt overturn roe ethic seem to be a major problem for our supreme court justice they lied to get the seat and are being bought by the very people who are against roe
supremely corrupt no lifetime term self policing or secret anything the whole setup is deeply flawed ripe for going sideways it did so it time for reform least complicated fact
so they did an entire story just to say they dont know what happened
they need to stop the lie they planned this a head of time anyone that cant see them for what they are is blind the people of the united state of america are in trouble big trouble this our country and we been sold out the whole world watching
maybe youd be happier in a communist country try moving to one
let stop kidding ourselves about the judiciary it is about politics not the law and reason kantor is covering for barrett because shes a woman not buying her story a a portrayal of the court a a noble institution
rescue both to the best of ability
so typical that the gilead level not so supreme court would be upset by the leak rather than their crap ruling that completely ignores the law
mr justice gorsuch thanks for spending 10 whole minute reviewing mr justice alitos 69page opinion of dobbs 69 page per minute that elianor wood speedreading course you took at yale really paid off for ya mr crow and mr leo sure got their money worth out of you
every time i hear justice kavanaugh i wonder justice kennedy stepping down and giving trump this liar
if the american people wish to know the history of little corrupt secret of scotus then buy the case against the supreme court by law professor chereminsky especially in the 1920 or at the turn of the 20th century regarding child labor i think even charles chaplin ha a movie and took a stand regarding robing stealing thefting the childhood of little american to satiate the suply and demand of worker for big corporation yes justice robing baron legalizing corruption
this entire story is b clearly her source are from robert office trying to paint him a trying to save roe but the leak messed everything up foh they had every intention of overturning roe and his descent wa just symbolic because he doesnt want the court to look partisan
sound like politics a usual i thought the supreme court wa not supposed to do that i know i dont have enough knowledge to speak about this in depth but all i can say is it seems like theyre doing the same thing that republican and democrat are doing i thought they were supposed to be a neutral and just based on the constitution but it really the same it all about power im so sad
how dare robert make such a statement he should be in prison right now with his wife for accepting bribe we need to march on the court and demand the 6 republican resign a theyre provably compromised
it the best court that money could buy
three branch of government yet one branch consists of 9 individual that were not voted in by the people and on top of that lifetime appointment thats not balanced at all the reason they do this is because they know they cant be removed or vote out garbage
a a christian im ashamed jesus would never want someone to lie their way to the supreme court to put up an abortion ban this isnt righteousness it evil pure human greed
everyone with two brain cell to rub together know it wa alito and that he leaked it to force the conservative to stick to stripping bodily autonomy from half the population republican and conservative will pay for this for decade
a bunch of conservative snake that cant be trusted no wonder the court ha a low approval rating because of these sell out corrupted judge
they will not answer truthfully if they answer at all
if anybody still belief that supreme court justice arent just politician in robe they havent been paying attention
no one get to decide what surgery i will have
in other word her reporting tell u nothing we didnt already know
it soooooo true these partisan republican justice are drunk on power and politics and knowing they can get away with crime is the reason why they need to be stopped
i dont now wher too longer
all six of these corrupt conservative judge are maga politics moscow mitch mcconnell and rrump conservative water carrying tool term limit would help but like gun legislation and weak republican excuse to do something they offer only mafia tactic and prayer and thought corruption at it best
so who wa paid off to get this decision scotus is corrupt
it wild how 6 people can decide the fate of 331 million people
maybe they should be looking into jan 6 being a inside job the new video evidence is pointing to that being a real possibility trump 2024
the supreme court of canada ha a retirement age of 75 the court work just fine
if justice amy want to have 7 or 10 kid it doesnt mean everyone should or want to they should have left roe v wade alone and mind their business
hmmwhy is she saying president trump biden is president just wondering whats the use more republican supreme court justice only time they voted correct wa when trump took his case there to overturn the vote to still be president they said no
quick reminder our constitution doe not say court justice get lifetime appointment it say shall retain their office under good behavior in the past we had justice who held to the standard of good behavior by not taking bribe not committing perjury by lying in the job interview they all held lifetime post because they refrained from bad behavior hence we do not have a system of lifetime appointment we have a system where a justice who refrain from bad behavior shall retain their office until they choose to retire or they expire constitution could have said life appointment but chose not to because life appointment invite dictatorial tyranny after some 200 year america came to see justice a having life appointment because of lack of crime on the bench but that is not what the constitution say the originalists on the supreme court have never even noticed this phrase or how it potentially limit their dictatorial power
which constitutional right is next to be taken away a easily
making unilateral decision about people healthcare from a bench is not only antithetical to democracy it wrong
i dont understand why the supreme court judge have never been charged with perjury during their sworn testimony at their confirmation hearing before congress
ive had taco at taco bell more supreme than this court what a stain on america
keep voting for gop and continue to watch your right vanish doh
so just blame biden in the made up impeachment
election have consequence remember that statement tough luck liberal
coathangerbarrett wa _trying_ for plausible deniability but this leak remove that plausibility
what else can boomer wreck in their limited time left
conservative are packing the court to force their will on society democrat need to stop play game and start packing to court no matter what because right isnt afraid to do the same abortion right shouldve been codified a long time ago now we got ta deal with these morality policeman being in installed on federal bench
the new justice had just went through lying about roe and it being case law
or maybe sound of getting canceled if the entirety of the justice on the supreme court think that abortion is wrong maybe it because it is wrong
it is way past time to dispense with the lifetime appointment rule i have nothing but contempt for this court their ethical standard are a joke some of them sit on seat that were stolen some of them are patently unfit doe what go around come around sound like a sentiment that a supreme court justice should hold
dont forget to vote for trump on november 13th
they did it
this is the evidence required to end lifetime roll term limit we need to make mandatory and soon
b she pulled a lisa murkowski she performed an ethical stance knowing full well her buddy would make sure she got to vote to wage war on woman she got to keep her hand clean while doing nasty
the thing that still bother me is the fact that justice alito included the history of 16th century view and feeling on abortion by sir edward coke in england claiming it a part of the us history when this country is only 250 year of being considered an entity in it own right our history a a country doe not carry forward the belief and law of england therefore quoting anything before 1776 from england a part of our history a a country is incorrect 50 year of having the right to abortion mean it wa and is deeply embedded in our history that is 15 of the year we have been an established county with our own law etc
there own by the republican party
context is everything and the crook on the scotus know that along with their corrupt ignorant clerk who are just religious and political fanatic in the antichoice lager and wacolike compound
this is sickening absolutely sickening vote blue insure woman right republican are intent on making woman second class citizen
trump mob would even embarrass some corrupt african nation the supreme court look to be the most crooked part of the usa what a joke these clown are so unpatriotic and disgraceful
gee msnbc need phony made up b to understand that the ussc decision sent it back to the state to decide dont worry democrat you can still extinguish human being
two men talking about abortion interesting
bravo to the brave patriotic person who leaked these supreme court back room dealing there clearly wa a personal agenda and a premeditated plan concerning the timing of their action this is so discouraging so disappointing but sadly not surprising or shocking in the least many of u saw this type of behavior coming when certain justice were appointed their job is to uphold the constitution of the united state and protect the right of all citizen they dont have to like abortion and they certainly dont have to get one but they do have to protect the right of others to make that choice for themselves the highest court in our land we look to them to make decision based on the constitution law and the good of the nation this pearl clutching because they got caught doing something they knew to be sneaky wrong is a silly a it is insulting there should be term limit for supreme court justice and the selection process need to be improved a well it will be interesting to see what else come out and what if any change occur because of this
bombshell the most used word in medium
how about we ask medical professional not once ha anyone with experience understanding and year of knowledge been involved in this b overturning
fatal pregnancy are not abortion but how many will lie and say their fetus is a toxic parasite that need removed
each supreme court justice wa asked during the vetting process if they would dismantle roe v wade and they all said they would leave that alone and the first thing they did wa dismantle it they are all lying christian
you will have that child in tx whether you want it or not you die or not you both die or not but you willhave it or run 4ur life in texas so help u our god
supreme crook
total abuse of power this is not a decision based on law it political you frigging idiot scotus not sure your god will forgive you for this one
i dont like how they are making it sound like elena kagan stephen breyerketanji brown jackson and sonia sotomayor a the supporter of the overturning of roe v wade just because theyre part of the supreme court doesnt mean they all voted in favor of it being overturned
yesterday i read the piece it is fabulous journalism a it need to be uncompromised and relevant it deserves an award the best at least for me of 2023
republiban gop anti choice death panel now operating over woman life in texas
need more than just white n one black thats the problem
the current supreme court contains too many odious creature dismiss the lot create a high code of ethic including oversight require a political balance on the bench ex 3 repubs 3 dems 3 indeps and term limit any lying cheating or political stunt get them dismissed from the bench permanently
a long a we respect religious belief and allow theocrats to be judge this will never end the three of them were put on the court to overturn roe it what they did it political it always ha been no judge is impartial or unbiased
when the law take a back seat to politics there is no law money cant buy
abortion ban is about work force not religion the far right are extremely immoral and also tend to be business owner they are struggling with having enough low level worker
supremecourt is a scam operation clean house
i hope people dont forget that trump single handedly destroyed roe v wade
chris hayes is so annoying just report the fact without sensationalistic spin
since corporation can not perish in the field of war they should pay the financial cost of the u military 100
100 bet that it wasnt the liberal who leaked it the conservative were the one with a motive ill bet chief justice robert investigation is just a red herring to deflect suspicion just like oj trying to find the real killer of his wife corrupt court indeed this decision will go down in history like dred scott the 1 position of woman according to poll is abortion vote blue in 24 then we need to pas a constitutional amendment for judge term limit across the board judgeship have become way to politicized
corporation dont even pay their fair share 4our military which protects their interest more than ours most time
kavanaugh is a lying liar who lie though he saw it a his birthright he ha no business sitting on the scotus
they really shouldnt be smiling for the pain and suffering they have caused
whatever you want msnbc will just make up something to lie about
those six pic of the sc judge could be at a carnival shooting gallery
roe v wade wa unconstitutional and needed to be overturn 1 there wa no federal law in regard to abortion therefore the supreme court wa making a law with the roe v wade ruling and the power belongs to congress not the supreme court 2 there is nothing in the constitution that give the federal government the power to regulate abortion therefore according to the 10th amendment that power belongs to the state
seems like someone would have preferred to hold off the case until after the election all for political reason
it seems to me that the supreme court is no longer supreme in brain
the supreme court ha destroyed their credibility on their own there are justice thomas alito for example who should clearly be removed a they have been proven to be corrupt term limit and clear legal law are needed for this court now
ruth refusal to step down while she had the choice to do so while the political landscape democratic president and congress is so incredibly selfish and she is the reason why roe wa overturned that a selfish woman is the reason that woman lost their right classic
please stop repackaging the same information and start digging up new information like journalist please we need the 4th of state
they made a whole movie about spin it called wag the dog spin doctor need to be exposed like the individual making up the electoral college maybe thats why the world is aiming for robot cant we be real with ourselves or do we need a war to make u come together a a country
i will never respect barrett for her to accept the position under the ramrod they used to put her in place after mcconnell derailed obamas nomination because it is too close to an election say loudly that she is not concerned with fair play she can not be trusted with her position let not forget that she and kavanagh both testified under oath to not upset the precedence of rvw it is a political court
republican are orwellian they talk about freedom while they are busy taking it from you
so what
so fake dem news say law is about which party ha power to divided without any constitutional argument that they are wrong you see sheep how they lie
a disgusting reprehensible a this story show the conservative of the scotus to be im in no way shocked especially about the revelation that it wa kavanaugh who wa responsible for scheming to take the case but move the date in order to deceive the public based on his action in the w bush administration his specific involvement in the ken starr investigationfishing expedition into bill clinton just on a basic human level the fact that ruth bader ginsberg a colleague of many of them for decade hadnt been deceased for more than a day before they began scheming to undermine her life work is a testament to the utter depravity of men like clarence thomas samuel alito in particular i dont know how much more reporting evidence could possibly be needed at this point to support the fact that these 2 obscenely corrupt political operative need to be impeached from the sc then there kavanaugh who needed multiple attempt to become a judge in the 1st place ha had more question arise about his ethic since becoming a justice than any other person ever confirmed to the court if he is to remain a justice then the sc need to enact an ironclad code of ethic the most scrupulous mean of enforcement of any of the lower court or the other 2 branch of govt combined even then the scotus need to be expanded to 13 justice to match the number of circuit court of appeal have term limit imposed by congress the last thing this country need is more bought paid for political operative w no reverence for the law or the right of the american people who arent just protected by their lifetime appointment but are actively immeasurably emboldened by them like thomas alito
this supreme court is corrupt history will show that the extreme faction of the catholic higher authority fronted by leonard leo the fascist opus dei a group of antidemocratic wealthy individual and the federalist society have had key role in the corruption of the third branch of govt under the u constitution the vast majority of american catholic oppose the effort to destroy religious freedom in the usa
this is absolute proof that the supreme court is purely political they want everyone to believe they actually consider the argument on each side then rule instead they do whatever their backer want them to do we still need to know who paid off kavanaughs huge debt just before he got on the court
maybe they were hesitant to take up and overturn roe because brett and amy had so recently taken an oath to uphold roe they took all of that dark money from the prolife faction they had to pay to the piper all of the rest of this is just smoke and mirror they are stuck with their lousy decision and it make them look like what they are bought and paid for
the republican are like the dog that love chasing car and finally caught one it doe not end well for the dog
let me guess thomas or alito leaked the decision both are ethically compromised and morally bankrupt mitch mcconnell ha a lot to answer for a well
013 what about the breach of trust this court did to the american people by overturning roe if he want to point a finger at someone over a breach of trust he need to look in the mirror first hypocrite
what repubs have done to our now inferior court wa 100 political the court now is a majority of repub aka fascist loyalist
plotting to deny woman their right is the breach of trust leaking it wa an attempt to save right
take away men reproductive right equal treatment no one get a say in their own health care snip snip gentleman no more viagra either if your god want you limp you stay limp and jail the doctor who fight for men right to their own body
this is what ha me nervous about this bench looking at the djt prosecution issue
every dem running for senate need to run on expanding the court voting right and preserving our democracy put the insurrection the coup the corruption of the gop and their bought and sold scotus justice on the ballot do not allow a republican a moment of peace in the public sphere without being on the record about these issue do not give the gop a platform for any other issue shout them down talk over them control the god damned conversation and most of all the doj need to start arresting and convicting these criminal including the bribed off scotus judge sic clarence thomas
lol supreme court called it breach of trust but there ha been no trust in these corrupted judge for a long time from the people
if you do not understand why the abortion process is necessary then you are not doing your due diligence and understanding thing over which you are voting and complaining the gop is against normal people they are against u succeeding and being educated and they want u to be sick why because our suffering their profit
a dem sc doesnt know what a woman is and in sport
this is all about them forcing their religion on u period
united state of theocracy
it been repeatedly proven there only one body of law maker the supreme court only 5 people rule supreme 5 of 9 right wrong logic illogic fair unfair is not required by the supreme court they are allowed to interpret the constitution however they wish just a the powerful have reinterpreted and even rewritten the bible to suit their law of god these 5 people have that power to override whatever they wish do you understand the unending reach of this 5 people only 5 of 9 justice have the power to determine what is law of the land in this ridiculous country not the 3 branch of governmentcongress not individual state of this country have the power to make the law of the land five 5 people of the supreme court hold all the power
nothing change what these conservative have done and will do
got ta say again it unfortunate that the democrat arent strategic or long range thinker they really had every reason for ginsberg to step down and be replaced by obama by a younger judge in the first place in the second place you know i dont know if there would be a second chance or on this but he had the opportunity to put merrick garland on the bench during a recess appointment and he chose not to it such a patronizing mentality so im not sure is it obamas fault that were in this place he did a lot for the gop who won were another did a lot for him helping him get into office he certainly failed to pas or even try to pas important legislation and let not forget those picture of child and dog cage were taken in 2014 part two of the short term stupid thinking of the democrat wa not having joe biden run for president in 2016 i supported hillary clinton for president in 1992 i thought shed be way better than her husband but it a lot easier to get a successful vice president on the heel of the president currently the democrat are trying to do that with kamala harris and it wont work because she doe not have leader ship charisma at all it not because shes black because shes indian it not because shes a woman it because shes a twinkly a little too faced woman with no managerial authority and i dont see her being a commanderinchief she just doesnt have that leader ship vibe i think she wouldve been a better ag way better than merrick garland and hillary mightve been an excellent vice president in that administration forging a steppingstone for her to become the first female president of the united state but a usual the democrat and leader ship back there and dc do not have any strategic foresight they dont seem to understand where people are at or how they look at thing they really seem to live in a bubble among themselves a elitist clueless patronizing and phony people i say this even though im a democrat it grossly disappointing that we have all these horrible people on the supreme court and half of them go back to the day when the democrat were all agreeable and allowing horrible people like clarence thomas onto the bench they were always being so collegial while their colleague across the aisle were always plotting the downfall of our democracy and the rise of fascism and oligarchy it wa obvious to anybody paying attention since the reagan and bush administration
this is a separation of church and state issue thinking that you are somehow killing child is a religionspecific dogma position not even part of many religion resulting primarily from a very common spiritual failure thinking that you must convert others to your belief rather than take responsibility for yourself it a selfimprovement avoidance pattern common among human a they avoid their own spiritual issue while massaging their ego about how good they are being it is used by political propagandist to promote voting regardless of the clinic violence and violence to woman they are winking at
what an awful corrupt court
this may be really off topici thought the nyt journalist wa a man until she spoke like a glitch in the matrix
america sure seems to be turning into a regressive hellhole
you can thank mitch mcconnell and the gop give them a thank you would you please have a great day take care and god bless
the jusitces didnt need to read the draft it wa written by the federalist society the society is the law
the supreme court overturning roe versus wade wa unconstitutional and it is a violation of other law the hipaa law prevent anybody from using your medical information and no state ha a right to stick their nose in your medical information i wish these attorney would actually utilize this information because it is accurate to the letter of the law you do not have to go to law school to understand the law you simply just have to have the ability and the skill to read and comprehend
supreme court justiced need to be elcted by the people with term limit
oh good the supreme court participates in political pr by playing the public a fool why am i not surprised that theyre just politician in black robe
it time for biden to pack the court
the supreme court is just a bunch of liar and definitely not for woman because it should be a federal right only s woman should have a say over her body since men dont have that baby in them that could only affect the rest of there life men dont usually have an attachment until after the birth remember who made all this happen the right wing extremist and romp who it will never affect
funny that all these privileged people who went to the best school couldnt understand the word choice in a case you dont like dont believe or dont want an abortion you have the choice to not get one just like the peple who do need or want an abortion have a choice to not believe a you do or have their religion pushed onto you
nothing change set limit on supreme court no more life term
oh no sc followed the constitution and dem news try to bandwagon with no constitution argument
the last four republican appointee said under oath that roe wa settled law in order to get on the bench they lied under oath let that sink in they lied under oath then the moment they have the vote to overturn it suddenly it no longer settled law they lied in order to get appointed to the bench so that they could do what their mega donor sent them there to do which wa to end roe v wade
the leak may have been inappropriate but the justice playing politics wa even more inappropriate i am very concerned of our future with a supreme court that is seemingly for sale to the highest bidder
access to the justice of the supreme court i heard today that it is very difficult to ask question of the justice it must be because we arent billionaire who have personal access to justice i wont use the word corrupt for scotus it is political we are a democracy we didnt vote for them now people have no access to justice in the beginning justice had a circuit to ride and they ate and boarded with the people they were given their salary to aid them in the hardship they had to endure riding circuit and being away from home these guy wont cancel lunch for any of u who are the people they have pulled out the bible quote from the worst of it and hammer the public with old testament vengeance because they see god a vengeful and they see themselves a god surrogate worried about trump wanting to be the king we ended up with at least 6 in the court
it appears that much of america democratic directive were established based on a reliance that the directive would be discharged with a modicum of honorability and respect seems a if this approach is coming apart at the seam
these corrupt judge make me sick
time to reign the court in i think they should be limited to 10 year not life in the position theyre obviously arrogant and disgustingly entitled alito and thomas need to be impeached because theyre blatant crook sucking off the teat of their privileged position it wa a criminal move by mcconnell when he denied obamas choice for the court obama wa a wimp he should have fought tooth and nail to fight that but he knew he wa on his way out and just didnt want the hassle for that alone i think he wa a failed president
msnbc is fake news msnbc is the enemy of the people
the right ha been planning to put these anti roe in for year even though it go against the majority of world opinion
i like msnbc in general but i would like it more without chris hayes he a bit overboardan extremist he push idea a little too far beyond the fact and try to sensationalize the news try to start fire in other interview of his ive seen not so much this one he very hyper and often interrupt his guest too much he need to tone it down or find another outlet
the supreme court see whats happening to our country why arent they doing something
i hope kavanaugh himself everytime he walk into his chamber
mississippi wanted to end abortion because that state is the highest in young black female mortality rate while giving birth or soon after legalized murder of young black breeder is all it is
hopefully people remember that the judge involved stated that they would not overturn precedent law without tacit change to the circumstance only one of the many lie they told to get appointed
vote blue so that they can expand the court
a republican led scotus is corrupt yes of course it is that wa the point
i think it wa alito who leaked it
the world is watching the u can not call themselves a country of democracy or law and order ever again what a joke the curtain ha fallen and we all see you now for what you really are corrupt violent antiwomen racist and fascist certainly not 100 but just look at who is actually ruling your country from your local school board all the way to the top all the while the people are playing with their toy and stuffing their face with greasy heartstopping burger and fry
a handmaide tale isnt supposed to be an instructional booklet
biden need to match the number of justice to the number of federal district
not allowing woman to make their own reproductive decision make them second class citizen lot of people are good with that
con and piracy put them together and you get conspiracy the court is the most corrupt in american history lock them up throw away the key
in an authoritarian country usually the authoritarian end bad in usa we have at this point 6 authoritarian that are going to retire from their luxury life despite how many american life they destroy and you the republican call the democrat and some other country third country and authoritarian country communist or socialist
a justice system that is so lost and broken make their citizen have no respect for that institution the supreme court should be abolished at this point
i dont care about the leak what concern me is that million of dollar were wasted during these confirmation that ultimately mean nothing kavanaugh and coneybarrett said in front of congress that roe v wade wa established law and these people clearly lied and are on the supreme court for life thats a problem
religion infused justice are exactly the wrong thing when trying to maintain separation of church and state
it okay with the justice violate ethicsbut not their assistant do a we say not a we do is not a good look for any judge or the rule of law
you missed the entire point of this story why wa the conservative wing of the court so fixated on roe why were they so motivated to change the law it is so incredibly obvious that it wa done for political reason to serve their political overlord and the federalist society this story strip the black robe and reveals a bunch of political operative
the current supreme court made u woman second class citizen again want to protect your right and your daughter mother sister aunty vote and bring like minded people to the poll
term limit vote across the board always
soooo thomas and all the trump appointed justice are just a heinous and immoral a is trumpinstain
woman in the u are now headed for a talibanlike existence pregnancy is now governed by the government and natural process that lead to an unviable fetus in the womb are now crime against the state
it wa donald trump who appointed those three zealot justice
john robert should be ashamed to lead the most corrupt court in living memory he should resign because of his failure
the u population ha doubled since the last time the number of sc justice ha been adjususted it is time for biden to immediately appoint at least 9 additional sc justice
the supreme court the easiest to buy these day
the justice released it on purpose thats my opinion
no one is above the law not even the mega republican the supreme court is the court that we depend on the supreme court should not have block the view are the abortion right clarence thomas and his wife should be fired do you know what theyre coming into supreme court judge they were not here trying to make money what they are trying to do thats a bunch of b
the only incentive you need to be a model citizen in this country is have an intolerance for stupidity once you become intolerable to stupidity youll do whatever it take to avoid the justice system in this country because it is full of our stupidest people from county level all the way to the supreme court
wheres the bombshell click bait trash
weird i thought it wa liberal who were activist judge who legislate from the bench
it easy to be prolife politically but when your wife or significant others life is hanging in the balance and her life is to be sacrificed to save a nonviable pregnancy then you have finally faced the failure of this regulation of the human body in protecting life
who need a constitution a congress or a president when you have these unelected lifeterm authoritarian forcing their vision of america on u they have made it clear that they are the law
havent we been told criticizing the court isnt protected free speech the court need to issue a gag order
best jutice money can buy so you think alito leaked or wa it thomas my money on alito
the corrupt state of america
probably leaked by stephen breyer on his way out the door
sound like one of the conservative justice leaked it to force the other conservative to vote in favor of overturning roe clarence thomas and sam alito are more like politician than justice
our supreme court can not be trusted
let remember for all rbg is revered she caused a shitshow by not retiring while a democrat wa president and could have named a successor theyre all the same their love of power and the prestige that come with it is more important than anything else
they didnt want to miss an opportunity to get paid to rule
treason
to me it is all wrong a tiny group of people supreme court decide on something that can affect a population of 300 million this should be decided by a referendum people can vote for what they want not for what 5 people want supreme court is 9 people but you only need 5
traitor appointed corrupt judge they are waiting for his command
who done it this abusive supreme court after 50yrs of a woman right protected this supreme court broke that trust for protection inside a patriarchal society the background of woman oppression for ionsusing oppression over woman for powerpower over here we are againjustices need to back to the drawing table and right their wrongstop trying to control woman and their body easy for you to pas viagra though sick
this whole affair make the u supreme court come across a just another political arm of the farright they show their theologic tie someone need to present the argument that justified abortion it requires an understanding of the nature and science of reproduction the antiabortion faction live in religious fantasy every time a woman menstruates she is killing a human being the farright feel no shame in diminishing the value of human after birth they deny the value of funding humanitarian effort
the not so supreme court
am remembering the judge who lied about overturning roe when they were being interviewed crook and liar on the court
thanks msnbc news
theyre coming after birth control next
republican contradict themselves in word and deed daily more so than some dirty democrat
obvious from the beginning conservative leaked to lock in vote we cheer these dumbass for their induced consequence that are demolishing the gop
united state supreme court is simply the upper house of the republican party
the other conservative might have giving cover to amy comey barrett during the early stage through her initial vote to not take up the case because of the inappropriate look much a a legislator are given cover on vote that damage their political position in getting reelected when their vote is not needed to pas the legislation
i think alito or thomas definitely were behind the leak
is it possible that people on the left could consider that may be the people who are against abortion truly believe it is wrong just like you might believe killing puppy is wrong and you might want that outlawed im prochoice but i understand the argument on the other side and i dont think the people are evil
we need so much more transparency from the supreme court bc if this is true then they didnt really lie to congress in their approval hearing to get their seat after allbut my strong sense and from all we know now of all the trump appointee he picked for top position throughout america institution during his term is that everyone wa made to sign ndas and promise of lip locked loyalty to him without question and it may be that he got the r on the bench divided for a reasonnot his but whatever his puppetmaster tell him to dohe doe he not to dumb to know that he clueless when it come to politics but he taking his order from our staunchest foreign enemy ive been consistent on this point from the very beginning no matter how he actedthats not part of my decision that he on the side of every one of our adversary and treat our ally like dirthe doe this in plain sight why is that ok with some american ive always been on the side of the underdog but this is not thatwatch how the leader of china and the like use these mind control techniquesits fascinating when it happening to others way over therethats all i can saythank god ppl here are saying lol sorry so long
she wa just using smoke and mirror if she wa serious she would have voted no in the final saying however there is also an element of control she is still a lower being being a woman so much corruption
all theyre doing is kicking the ruling back to the state which is where it supposed to actually be
the u constitution specifically forbids any attempt to establish a state religion it follows then that any evidence that relies on the supposed word of some invisible unseen entity the evidence for whom relies entirely on the word in a single ancient unreliable selfcontradicting book which few of it selfprofessed adherent have ever actually read should play absolutely no part in lawmaking in other word if you want the usa to follow the law of a god then hesheit should be ready to appear in court to justify and explain those law you know the sort of thing why slavery is good genocide encouraged a are stoning naughty toddler to death and banning woman from holding holy office the silliest thing is that the organisation that claim to believe these thing are not u taxpayer but they still bleat and whine about tax dollar being wasted on thing that the supposed founder of their religion commanded they do the really funny thing is just how few of them seem able even to spell hypocrisy
so if this investigative reporter delved deep into the situation with the supreme court and the alleged leak of the draft decision then why didnt her investigation reveal the culprit who leaked the draft
and usa justice system is corrupt what is going on in this country is it just the beginning of a total collapse a it sure seems so everyone is just in it for themselves what a corrupt corrupt country
rbg wa good but should have retired during obama administration
these people want you to believe their conclusion are valid even though the evidence of the corruption of scotus is obvious the duplicitousness is of a trumpian scale
term limit and accountability for the supreme court now
200 in nothing when chris say i forgot about the detail i have not
if it look like a duck quack like a duck it a duck
the 1973 sc decision said that woman had the right to bodily autonomy the male justice on the present sc said no they dont
this make me upset the fact that people have the power to harm people woman are being treated like secondclass citizen
trump wanted to seat justice that would overturn roe so the sc justice went with politics their religious belief not the constitution
this supreme court conservative men are about politics they are fabricating legal interpretation that magically align with their personal political leaning that make them nonelected lawmaker and not interpreter of the law
these kind of wherever they are are claim they are religious and good people but you look at their face and you can see the nastiness and hatred there because of all the pain they carry around with them when youre this evil the universe wont let you be happy
trump figured out how to tear down the trust in every america institution in 4 year in office why are these justice using their belief or opinion a metric for which to judge your job a a judge is to follow the law the constitution it ha nothing to do with anyones political opinion or religious belief the entire gop is dirty and trying to destroy our nation
of course the newly appointed justice committed perjury during their confirmation hearing they were inherently uncomfortable about striking down roe v wade they wanted a period of time to allow public acceptance of their tainted confirmation
john robert ha a lot of nerve to talk about this leak being a breach of trust the scotus ha broken the trust of the people i literally see them a enemy of liberty and democracy at this point none of them care about justice or do process just more greedy little child
manassehisrael1025 you are taking the lord name in vain fake christian
the most corrupt supreme court in american history
she is field dependent and unable to weigh other concern she is deaf to human concern other than being the darling of zealot she is a zealot and so is alito who is back in the 1500s he hate woman
it show to all those watching how easy it is to take over powerful position in usa you better believe theyre watching
if something is being leaked it mean something is being hidden hidden from we the people we are not governed we are ruled
she ha seven child and an army of people to care for them she could have advocated a a woman for some concern that are now evident she did nothing
jody kantor is clear concise thank you for your insight and reporting
contact your federal legislator and say you wont vote for them unless they bring legislation to codify roe into law no compromise
barrettcover your own butt
the supreme court need to have their medical license revoked
relisted a crime against humanity
so msnbc is just realizing they were eagerly waiting for rbg to die so they could do this now seriously
it wa either alito or thomas my money is on clarence
shame republican
roman 126 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affection for even their woman did change the natural use into that which is against nature king james version kjv
please never have this lady on again
defund the supreme court
blame cleta mitchell and her protege leonard leo
why would a justice choose to be regarded a a political hack rather than one of the nation great jurist
the frothestate work again you do know dont you thatthe 5th filth estate gave birth to yours right question like immunity do you think it is something god will ever ever ever claim for himself better shoved into hand of big wig right and so boom the froth4thestate nurtured and supported said infantever since frothvery important substance dont you know a mother or nurse still issue it seems father well like i said the filth estate of course and yes it knew it would need some protection someday see a lot of froth let loose if that ever hit a wall right
once upon a time i felt like i leaned republican but now i will never forgive them and never forget that theyre trying to do to woman economics foreign policy nothing of it matter if we dont even have basic human right in the first place
of course this person giving supreme court apologetics is from the new york time a right leaning paper and not known for honesty this reporter want to mislead make people think the majority on the supreme court arent domestic terrorist who want to destroy our country w christo fascism
all medical decision should never be made by anyone except a patient family and the doctor doctor are the authority for medical decision they have more education than a lawyer and they know their patient better than any politicallyappointed judge
the liar on the supreme court that overturned roe v wade need to be impeached for lying under oath
start shopping for your hajibs lady this is only the beginning of what they want to do to u

im going to channel my friend chandler bing here could america be more corrupt like the third world country american are always on about
woman didnt create their body themselves nor did woman create the baby by themselves
your headline sound disgusting
this is from 2022 why is it being posted a news
the supreme court under republican is corrupt the senate under republican is corrupt the house and congress under republican is corrupt and the presidency under republican is corrupt so can your imagine what would happen if all those duck line up
anyone that think the scotus is not corrupt this is all the proof needed that they are
woman body woman make decision not you sham
republican are trash
whoever wa responsible for the binder at the time of it going missing should be questioned and held accountabke
you can bet that wealthy republican will have access to abortion and will use it
it is absolutely sick what is going on in the u my honest take on what is going on is that every single woman in the u should leave the country all at once in protest that might get their attention
democrat are something else boy smdh and i used to be a democrat in 2008 but they are pure evil now
the thing this tell me is the court must be much more open with their deliberation this wa all very underhanded and clearly an abuse of the respectability of the court these justice dont deserve the secrecy they demand and we cant afford it
it wa alito and thomas who leaked the draft
republican anti freedom party
whats next atheism becomes illegal childless is illegal fahrenheit 451 slavery return child bride burka it sure seems like the state is already sliding down the slippery slope never say never
they have not held up their oath of office we do not need justice on the supreme court who respect the oath they took
conservative mean to not allow progress and control all our life to keep u all in place because of an ancient religion brought to u from the old world
the current u supreme court is a breach of trust
term limit now omfg disgusting and outrageous omfg
the supreme court smell like bad fish i dont trust them at all anymore lifetime appointment should be stopped immediately all it doe is breed corruption what motivation do these judge have to play by the rule when they dont have to answer to anyone and cant lose their job no matter what they do
im just astonished how they are allowed to serve after lying to congresssenate and taking bribe etc smh
i do not trust the super majority they lie they cheat
seems like a lack of transparency transparency is the heart of democracy
rgb helped create all of this turmoil by refusing to step down when her health wa obviously failing ironically she bear a large portion of blame for the demise of roe v wade
dipshits for trump
term limit and ethic rule for scotus 10 yr period end of story it sad when the highest court in the country is full of political hack and grifter voteblue
ive got my money on ginny being the leak
amy changing her vote on taking the case is meaningless it just for appearance and change nothing about how i see her shes still a dreadful person
the blame should fall on ruth bader for not stepping down when she could have been replaced her desire to clutch the power until it had to be pried from her dead hand cost every woman in this country their right to choose
ruth ginsburg should have retired when obama asked to but noooooo she had to play justice till she died putting herself above country shame power corrupts now woman pay the price
scotus surely torpedoed the gop they havent won an election since
why doe not the news report the truth they ruled that we have no right to privacy
and if weasel garland wa not being paid off 3 of them traitor would be in prison
it wa justice alito it not hard to figure out who leaked the dobbs decision he did it to force the others into not changing their mind to this new 15 week ban that justice robert wa touting
they are plotting to make american woman brood mare n korea china and russia are wanting bigger birth rate for economics and soldier now we can say the republican have the sane agenda johnson ha said that all the aborted baby could have been viable tax payer
the sc ha been about politics for decade now theyre not about reason
isaiah 325 the vile person shall be no more called liberal nor the churl said to be bountiful king james version kjv
it not democracy if the majority of people want something and supreme court go against that
lawrence need some yacht time to think about it
repuglicans had been politicking on abortion for decade and then when they finally had to vote to overturn roe v wade they had to choose between enraging the evangelicals or the rest of the country may they go down with the evangelical ship there a reason religion is in decline some people recognize hypocrisy and unethical behavior
the american evangelical fascist would have been ok to elect the devil for president if he helped them to overturn roe v wade and they came very close to the dark lord with trump
this christian fundamentalist scotus is severely overstepping their boundary duty overturning roe wa purely politically ideologically driven they were more interested in shoving their personal opinion down the throat of the american people than following the law settled precedent also ill never forgive rgb for not stepping down during obamas 1st term when she couldve allowed him to replace her with someone like minded
love that all their machination have actually increase support for abortion whod have thought
term limit and right of recall
when i think of supreme court judge i think of liar and paid for tool
contrary to what democratsliberals and their propaganda outlet are trying to make people believe the u supreme court did not ban abortion they simply and constitutionally ruled that abortion is up to each individual state and not the federal government tenth amendment the power not delegated to the united state by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the state are reserved to the state respectively or to the people
yea so what will happen nothing the rich get away with treason against the people will again and we bend over and take it the french had the right idea in 1789
so someone saw them scheming the american people behind closed door and leaked the document in hope of a change good on whoever did that thats more american than what these religious zealot are trying to do
it absolutely hilarious how stupid msnbcs reporter make fox look it real reporting with undeniable evidence hayes is the man
let just hope american vote blue and make republican pay for taking away right
abortion restriction have already been influencing election im sensing a crushing defeat for the right wing in 2024
excuse me since when is determining constitutionality done in secret leak within the military is treason maybe the court should focus on billionaire destroying this democracy
justice clarence thomas should do the right thing and resign it probably the biggest single immediate step that could be taken to restore faith in the supreme court id be fine with replacing him with another conservative provided they were someone with integrity competence and loyal to the constitution
and alito is scumalong with thomas gorsuch kavanaugh and barrett all of them are liar
abortion should be an option i mean taxpayer shouldnt have to pay for it tho
alito lied the founder didnt allow abortion franklin in his publication gave a recipe for inducing abortion and warned woman to stay away from fancy men go ahead magats push this we not miss your circus in congress npr
i dont think coathanger barrett trying to protect her reputation mean i need to think any differently about her she suck just like the rest of these boughtandpaidfor conservative it is disgusting
msm ny time
i think the bombshell wa the supreme court justice illegally placed by trump that spoke of human being a if we are cattle herd and her the sheppard we are part of your eugenics program btch and that alone should have forced the president hand to come to woman defense rather than leaving them out to dry we need to elect a president that isnt a geriatric white man
we liberal can cry all we want but rbg new she wasnt going to live forever she should have stepped down when obama wa president and the dems had control of the senate but no she evidently thought she would live forever so i blame her and i blame obama when he nominated gerrick and the senate led by mcconnel stalled obama should have gone ahead and appointed gerrick saying the senate role wa to advise and consent not to stall but no
the problem is the majority of ww voted for dt in 2016 and in tx 62 supported r being elected which now tx ha a full court with r serving beto should have won so if you are putting race over gender then eventually you will be affected by the same extremist patriarchal system that affect marginalized woman j
conservative are apparently for small government but are happy to tell people what to do with their bodiespeak hypocrisy
look we all know alito wa the leaker
i do feel bad because sotomayor kagan and brown are not at all part of this theocratic nonsense i dont like them getting lumped in with the welldeserved hatred the other six get
the supreme court is full of liar
the reversal of roe needa to be overturned
our federal justice are no longer about the the rule of law but the power of politics such a shame
i wonder given the damage the dobbs decision did to the republican in 2022 and in the many referendum on abortion and gop special election disaster if this conservative majority would have overturned roe given the devastating fallout for the gop i predict it will lead to massive gop loss in 2024 poll show the gop ha never been more unpopular the dems are taking the white house and both chamber of congress next year thanks primarily to the dobbs ruling
i seriously doubt that the supreme court will find the leaker
there two that are maga republican judge not only favoritism to hide then when all is forgotten then the rabbit is out of the hat there should be more democrat on the supreme court why did obama not filled that seat how did mitch mcconnell sneak that woman into that seat no doubt just recently two justice on the supreme court should had been disqualified yes thats right disqualified off their rocker they knew they were wrong they made up there own law and place themselves above law of our constitutional because they subject of the same law that goven the american people and including the president they the three of themselves have valilated there oath of office by the 14th 3 amendment
three of these trumpsollini scotus judge lied under oath in their preappointment hearing and now theyre personification of maga evil when these stooge grant trumpsollini total immunity then so ha president biden
_ a per her bible barrett doesnt care about being a 2nd class u citizen but to make her fellow female 2nd class too just might ease the pain a bit is that it amy just like a dab of iodine or mercurochrome
i see this a just another way to divide the people in the usabecause divided we fall we failchoice is the one given right god gave the worldthis is not abou prolife or prochoice this is all about dividing the people of the usa just like democrat or republicanslaws are made to protect those rightslike the hippa law roe v wade confession right catholic or tax exempt lawsi would like to see scotus rule on confession right and the tax exempt lawsif scotus ruling against abortion and contraception but leaf medication like viagra on the marketa contradiction of right
scotus is the most corrupt branch of the u government
like there is literally a whole political party based on killing baby
i am a new convert to republican justice over turning roe v wade bothered me but when it come to law making way for genderaffirming puberty blocker and hormone treatment for minor it must be stopped immediately i am glad we have 6 republican leaning supreme court justice i am with them now
put sen whitehouse in the whitehouse in 2024
alito probably leaked it himself
the breach of trust came from the supreme court when nominee lie under oath then refuse to recuse themselves for conflict of interest they should all resign period
in their confirmation hearing gorsutch cavenaugh and coneybarrett all said row wa estimated legal precident then ruled to over turn it the first opportunity they had
the only thing that trump ha been right about is that the total system is corrupt and of course a a totally corrupt person he want to be at the top
interesting people these christian judge this supreme court is now like catholic church full of secret and crime against humanity
no bombshell detected
you cant call them justice if they lied on their confirmation hearing
dont tell me let me guess ginny thomas
the supreme court is a breach of trust
liar appointing liar
while they protect the embryo before that child is born but when the child grow to school age and killed by gunman that is ok with them what do they really want
the democrat have been hijacked by godless baby killer who want to turn child into trans
so dismantling roe v wade wa a goal doesnt that negate the authority of being a judge sound like they have acted like tool
we need to remember that barrett ha 7 child because she adopted some are not her natural child and obstetrical doctor warn against having that many child because it take a serious toll on the woman health these thing need to be said publicly so that woman who have not had child and men who will never suffer pregnancy and childbirth will begin to be aware there is a complete disconnect in our society of what woman actually go thru and the long term affect on the woman
i have a much confidence in the supreme court a i do the corrupt fbi agent that are still employed many agent have also received a promotion for their corruption it make me sick to my heart i hope theyre happy
democrat are an evil evil party now and this is coming from a former democrat
there is leadership and there is following the court failed in leadership roe v wade created one national law for abortion overturning it creates 50 state law that is failure of leadership in effect denying medical care to woman
this court robertskavanaugh beret and thomas are a breach of trust
robert say this leak wa a breach of trust not a much a the breach of trust created when they betrayed their oath and the nation playing politics with people life and bringing suffering to woman everywhere in their effort to turn back the clock to a time when woman were the property of men
justice alito wa and is the leak
how dare they make killing baby illegal thats transphobic
the scotus is so corrupt how can we ever respect their opinion such a disgrace to our country
let get to the bottom of this
just the fact that they discussed the scheduling of the hearing of the case show what a fd up clubhouse the supreme court is now
literally everyone upset about this are godless baby killer
the supreme court is long overdue for a tuneup if not a house cleaning i wish it deserved the title supreme but lately it feel more like substandard so disappointing
the result of religious brain washing of child from an early age backed up and reinforced by fear of judgement man rule with the woman a second class who ha to do what they are told if they know whats good for them
it very clear all these justice have no backbone to stand up for america democracy america demand justice she cry for justice and she will have justice lock trump up now
abort the supreme court
i think bombshell is doing a lot of heavy lifting here the court is illegitimate and wholly corrupt not sure why everyones so surprised
let make this very simple when one party intentionally stonewalls an appointment and then press forward multiple appoints by their own party to create a conservative majority that result in the changing of law that the majority of american do not want it is absolutely political period full stop when you have justice that lie and say one thing to get appointed and then do another they are not judge of high integrity they are politician period full stop there need to be scotus reform oversight ethic standard and term limit
a corrupt bunch
lock trump up now
oh please we all know that a republicanstacked court wa always going to overturn roe there wa absolutely no chance it wasnt gon na happen this ha been their goal for decade well one of their goal this wa inevitable if it took republican another 30 year to get a majority they would have still overturned roe the first chance they got the only way you can stop this is to stop voting for republican period if you want to keep your right and you know the republican are against you absolutely never vote for a single one of them and always vote
literally everyone whose pro abortionist are godless baby killer
rbg should have stepped down in 2014 she didnt and amy barrett will now be a reliable rightwing vote for 40 year did it to yourselves white woman take that 53 of you who voted for trump and figure out how to fix the abortion mess that you created
with great power come great responsibility apparently absolute power becomes corrupts absolutely it is time to restore balance to the supreme court to restore our right and freedom
7 kid tf cap those tattered frayed tube
i think ginni thomas leaked it she had access to her husband computer and we know she wanted roe gone they hid who did the leak to protect her
kangaroo court basically the idological cesspool of the slop known a conservative
seems from outside the u like deep corruption prejudicing case before trial
the fix wa in when mcconnell interfeed with the functioning of government during the obama administration and the orange mob bos gained power everything else is just lipstick on a pig
i ejaculae more substantial load than whatever this cm rag of a court pass a tenured stability
every time they think they win they loose more election vote blue and reinstate woman right to healthcare
conservative will reverse the ban on abortion when they realise that the growth of nonwhite population is increasing significantly
roe v wade wa always going to be tossed out by this supreme court the whole song and dance of careful deliberation wa just a much a song and dance a the gop swearing to listen to the evidence against trump for his impeachment and then openly saying well never vote for impeachment the democrat know it the republican know it and even the neutral voter know it
so they conspired strategically it wa all step by step plan and what about all these case conservative are putting forward that are fake like the wedding planner who wasnt a wedding planner who made up a case and got it all the way to the supreme court i call b
truly awful reporting the court didnt take dobbs to spit on ginsberg grave they already had the majority ginsberg herself said that dobbs wa bad law and would get overturned at least the guest host tried to tamp down on his conspiratorial claim
what doe this have to do with the law this is entirely political worrying about appearance over substance is always political this is just disgraceful
the scotus itself is a breach of trust in 2023 trump scotus is corrupted to it conservative authoritarian racist misogynistic core
all six member shown on this video should be permanently removed from the scotus disbarred and placed in prison for their level of corruption
when your country start stripping you of basic human right and civil right you no longer live in free country you live in a country ran by the church via the old prune elected into office over half the civil and basic human right taken away from american have come with this phrase said by the politician that supported it it against my religious view and in good faith i couldnt support or pas a bill that go against my god you want freedom it need to start with all that serve federal and public office to sign a neutrality agree this would have them agree that they will not allow their religious or personal belief or feeling influence the law they pas rather they will do what the people want or what is best for the people you know the one of many faith and culture second that is all member of both house of government shall serve a max of 2 term of 4 year each these term start via election at same time a the president elect is chosen third no one that ha been impeached shall be allowed to run for office that includes the potus any federal office and publicstate office
cant we just come out and say what we all see that alito is the source of the leak
cant we just come out and say what we all see that alito is the source of the leak
prolife forever
clickbait there no bombshell here it doesnt tell u anything about the leak
the supreme court sucksleaks are happening frequently that just confuses people but i have to believe the supreme court will protect mother a well a fetus no woman should de because the fetus they are carrying ha catastrophic future woman arent incubator the recent woman who had to have the procedure to save her own life should not be decided by legislator politician doctor know what is best for patient not judge legislator or politician the supreme court ha to see medical complication a actual real life scenariosthis isnt what ifs
that will cost many life
time to ignore and cancel the supreme court the are obsolute and have nothing to do with justice
i think the justice are just upset because it came out that 5 justice or known liar
lie once again by the dishonest corrupt leftist what a bunch of medium hack you medium loser the ruling had nothing to do with overturning a right to an abortion
more on the wreckage of the u justice system brought by trump et al
i like jodi kantors analytical mind i wouldnt mind seeing her on more often for future discussion
ginny thomas leaked the draft to politico sam alito and clarence thomas were in on it none of these three people can be trusted to tell the truth about anything
this nonsense will hand democrat win next year
breach of trust this right wing scotus is beyond trust they are a kangaroo trump court
alito said that abortion is not mentioned in the constitution you know what else isnt mentioned in the constitution capitalism god jesus these theocrats need relocated to afghanistan
i still blame hillary for this
why is it just wonens health sue for discremination
the united state is backwards and behind in so many other way why not in this bit of personal liberty a well
person a should never ever make medical decision for person b pro life is made up by conservative radical to push their unfavorable position ending an embryo to save the life of the woman carrying it outweighs those radical opinion
clarence thomas had an abortion actually still doe his wife
no report on the american people being removed from home to make room for illegals
so the supreme court isnt above playing politics this is a thing i so do not want to believebut the evidence is incontrovertible and that beerboy kavanaugh should openly suggest deceiving the american people so that amy conehead can look good well that one is not a surprise whats most disappointing is where were the liberal justice during all thiswhy didnt they speak out to the american people once it became clear that trump patsy were working to make themselves look legit like right after theyd lied to congress about roe all i can say is theyd better stay holy on the presidential immunity case bc now all eye are on them
so american are by a strong majority prochoice but a strong minority of religious fascist is antichoice but against all logic abortion will be banned for decade this is a disaster and shouldnt happen in a democracy the u political and judicial system is perfectible
communist democrat and their terrorist projecting their thirst for murdering unborn child and woman right
at best these dishonorable agent of christian apologism use their power for flagrant abuse of religious dogma that get metastasis into secular law now dripping with the venom of christian nationalism this is basic treason and an overt denial of their oath to our republic
biblicallyspeaking life begin at birth read the bible and note the many passage with the phrase breath of life this isnt some superpower of god this is god defining life a the moment when a person take their first breath this whole debate is a farce by an extremist group parading a deceitful interpretation to gain and hold political power
so we are blaming the right wing justice for all the abuse they are committingwhen in fact they were appointed by one leonard leo and confirmed by one mitch mcconnell and his right wing republicansthese right wing justice were carefully selected for that purposeand if we think is only about abortion think again dont forget that are there for life and they were selected young in age for a reason we are in big trouble on this countryand if we think the abortion ruling is based on on religion then we are been fooled that ruling is all about money and power nothing to do with religion believesince the bible doesnt condemn abortion so we are in danger with this right wing republican justice of losing our democracybeware of all the right winger with deep pocket cause their power is not limited to the supreme courtall the federal court are in this texas come to mind wake up america let vote all these right wing republican out of every office of legislation in this our republicenough
medical procedure getting politicized is practice of medicine without a license there is a reason why obgyns got to school for 12 year
the last thing you want to happen is for them to find out who ignored the confidentiality of the court and blabber mouth they were taking up the abortion issue because you know it wa a leftist
and nobody saw this coming from the moment of the decision of roe versus wade the conservative political wing pushed via their appointment to move back toward abortion restriction
nothing more than a bunch of overpowered silly figure
dont forget that these justice lied under oath about rvw being settled law
a a retired judge i have long held the supreme court in high regard i know have nothing but contempt for the body
theyre mad about a breech of trust on their side to distract from the betrayal of faith for faith put in the supreme court that the vaaast majority of american support roe v wade and this isnt about law at this point it about not having proper separation of church and state because clearly woman with their doctor should determine whats right for the woman not politician stealing or right and trying to silence the majority all thanks to corrupt republican
a bunch of catholic deciding it is woman rped little girl job to hurt suffer cry to pleasure their sadist self
a clear case of how politicized the court ha become another stab in the back of it legitimacy a the arbiter of american justice
ordering an investigation into who did it but no investigation into the crime violation of law committed by regular citizen are crime but not if a scotus justice like clarence doe it not recusing in a trial against his wife9 and not investigating corruption biden should have nominated 4 justice and the new majority should have passed ethic rule even with the option to kick out corrupt and criminal justice now trump will nominate 4 more justice like judge aileen and jim jordan only condition is absolute loyalty to trump against the constitution
yes no trust for the doj
the supreme court are no longer credible they are all compromised and rule how the bank corporation and their master order them to they are of no use or value to or for the american people
what is the basis of law if not religiously held moral value
we need to replace supreme court every few year
i still contend that it wa sotomayor all along who leaked the draft dobbs opinion
i think the country should way new way preventing preacancies birth control pill for men etc
they dont say who leak it so dont waste your time on this video
pelican brief
they may take our dog but they will never take our fleadumb mean what
they leaked it to soften the blow and should be sued for practicing medicine without a license
our family decided to leave the u mainly due to this issue and also the safety problem i will not let the untrained and uneducated people push their religion to decide what medical care i need or my child in the future
the supreme court didnt take abortion right away they moved the decision about abortion right out of the federal government and closer to the people just like republican constitutional democracy demand
the supreme court is corrupt
her vote to not take the case wa entirely selfserving not ethical and that leak changed absolutely nothing i dont care what the justice claim they went in with the sole purpose of overturning roe
infiltrated with trumpers
the court are crooked thomas is proof of that i think they will support trump throughout a they both need each other to keep what they both want
yet more evidence suggesting that the u supreme court ha become illegitimate
you can still get one in 99 percent of the country so whats the big deal
total b they turned it over to the state to decide if you live in a libtarded leftist democrat state you can keep slaughter baby all day long so abortion isnt banned in the usa
whats the problem i flew business class to europe for my abortion and stayed at the ritzcarlton i dont see the problem
alito leaked that document no doubt
the supreme turd
regressive scotus and what are check and balance for this body of justice wake up usa they do have a fiduciary responsibility to the rule of law
thank you jody and adam
the writer of the draft is the the leaker duh
i believe that alito is the leak
i knew it right away it wa leaked by a conservative why it would have been more helpful politically if it wa leaked later for liberal you dont need to be named niccolò to figure it out
woman need to start thinking about the law needed to control men body the way they control woman body fornication and adultery are prohibited in the bible yet men do it all the time and get away with it and they cause unwanted pregnancy ther must be law set in stone regarding men body in our judicial system and it time to balance the scale men can not have their cake and eat it too
i no longer trust the sc corruption ha already entered the sc by keeping it a secret they denied the voice of the people to share their perspective they slapped the majority of american people while supporting the minority group will never forgive the sc
it not about politics remind me dont we have a highly corrupted judge that still resides in there with bribe from rich business people
the supreme court government ha no right in the right of a womanwhy is they still fighting slavery
what is so supreme about a court of 9 people stabbing each other in the back and leaking information wa clarence the only person who knew ginni wa working with insurrectionist yeah right
if the american people vote for a referendum it can introduce a term limit
justice robert should have shown the same amount of outrage about justice clarence behaviour and lack of ethical standard being demonstrated by his fellow judge and leave woman right alone
wa the plan leaked by alitos office it certainly look that way it wa a mean to expedite the clampdown on and removal of civil right in the usa filthy business never turn your back on these justice they have no justice intended for you
the next time the democrat get all three branch of government they have to fix the supreme court what a disaster
we are doomed a it is nearly impossible to amend the constitution partly because any amendnent can be blocked by a mere 13 state withholding approval and since the constitution is the supreme law of the land it can not be changed by any process except for another amendment doe this directly effect the supreme court i dont know but im guessing it doe the equal right amendment sorry lady is still in limbo a century after a guarantee of gender equality wa proposed to congressthe era wa proposed in 1923 but did not pas congress until 1972 and under u s law amendment to the constitution must be ratified by three fourth 38 of the state legislature and do not require presidential approval
rule for thee not for me
the problem in the u is that president are allowed to nominate their choice for the court this need to be taken away from politician and done by some other mean that remove partisan politics from the process there is no way it a fair and balanced system if the court becomes another arm of the party in power
this is clearly disgustingthey all must be laughing their way to the bank both figuratively and literallydid that earn thomas and his wife another hefty deposit to their account no amount of is worth the pain and suffering to anyone that need an abortion then to take the right to choose away
chris and jody i applaud all that you do i implore you to always include commentary on the right agenda to eliminate the separation of church and state a nothing more than a lever to clutch on to power at the cost of woman right woman know when theyre ready to be mom it not up to anyone else also please always include framing on the societal impact of underparented child the right prolife til birth and proprison til death are a contradiction that are both morally and fiscally bankrupt nutured child push themselves to become capable adult unwantedundervalued child push away struggle need grace from others all the sacred text discus this to limit yourself to one book or worse someone el interpretation of one book is america new pandemic
surprise surprise a bunch of men decided to strip woman of our bodily autonomy asapdisgusting
in making their judgment the conservative justice helped a lot of republican politician lose their job
ah yes blame the leaker not the poor justice
whats up with rudy
chris hayes reading into thing that people didnt say sorta seems like a conspiracy theorist
coward and liar and turd oh my
breach of trust who
who listens to msdnc
they all lied under oath
scotus is the breach of trust
who keep these republican rico political honest their action smell what will they hide when the insurrection and republican attempt to destroy our democracy surface
ginsberg stood in the gao a long a she could keeping american woman from being chattel and now she is gone and so are woman right amy coney barrett is the worst kind of traitor
breach of trust is what these supreme court member did to the entirety of the american people to be exact their decision open the legal door to declare all right not written down in the constitution and amendment a not right at all to be crystal clear right written into the constitution are legally called enumerated right meaning theyve been written down in the constitution before this abortion decision there used to be right called unenumerated right meaning they are not written down anywhere in the constitution unenumerated right were one like a right to travel a right to wear the cloth you want a right to eat the food you like madison pointed this out before the constitution wa finished in the federalist paper and wa deeply concerned because he believed a supreme court might nullify all unenemerated right in a decision and this supreme court did just that with this abortion decision saying the constitution make no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion the constitution make no express reference to a right to wear the clothes you want either see it now what this supreme court ha done with this abortion decision is say there are no unenumerated right that you do not have a right to eat what you want you do not have a right to travel you do not have a right to wear the cloth you want and all similar thing this because those are not written down in the constitution enumerated this is what madison wa terrified of that a supreme court would make such a decision and they just did so believe it or not american no longer have a single right to do anything that isnt outlined specifically in the constitution theyve declared all unenemerated right a unconstitutional with this abortion decision outlined in their opinion hows that for a wake up call bet you didnt know either did you
man it must be a pain in the backside for the honest fair thinking more intelligent democrat supreme judge dealing with the corrupt bias le intelligent republican supreme judge who hold the majority
thanks trump and the republican partyyou big dummiesfred sanford
the six justice who are roman catholic should have disqualified themselves it like christian scientist judge banning appendicitis operation
mthe conservative on the bench are owned by the koch
six of the most hated and vile people on the court we wouldnt be going through all this upheaval if they had just left roe a is it clear they hate woman and consider u to be 2nd hand citizen to be barefoot and in the kitchen or bedroom and nowhere else i hope woman unite and get each and every one of the gop out and vote blue for all woman out there this scotus is the beginning of the end
most of the people who claim to be against roe have never actually read it it had different requirement for each trimester of pregnancy
abolish lifetime appointment
old news
so my takeaway is that supreme court judge do not just benignly sit and wait for case to reach their court and then let the law decide in honest and open debate nothing could be further from the truth they have pre determined agenda and they play politics lie cheat steal to achieve it bending the law to do a they their billionaire ownersdonors want
the supreme court is corrupt and not a democratic institutionit is an archaic model under the fashion of a monarchy or roman republic there should be no position for life in america it wa all a well played game
collectively we deserve everything that is coming including this topic of course i do not agree
they acted like vulture they lied corrupt not for the people they are for their own agenda for theocracy
a very corrupted supreme court and even lower court all these justice have been bribed it is about controlling every aspect of woman life
thats exactly what it look like
im so not surprised the only thing supreme about them is their hypocrisy entitlement and total lack of integrity
the breach of trust wa done by the lying member of scotus that wouldnt reveal their bias stance on row v wade we have no sympathy for you supreme court
98 of biologist agree that human life begin at fertilization you might a well argue that evolution is just a theory at that point the fact that human life begin at fertilization ha more scientific support than global warming doe among geologist let that sink in
dont we all know it wa either alito or thomas or their staff on explicit request of the injustice who leaked the oppinion to pressure gorsuch kavanaugh and barrett
got to rework law governing the scotus we now see this is a court of greed and corruption they make the roman senate and the chief priest and the pharisee of jesus day look like school boy to be fair not all but enough of them known crook passing judgemental it some case to the highest bidder god hated corrupt judgement so bad he said he will clothe himself in righteous and fight against it isaiah59 if god said he hated it they are not getting away with anything
did she get her clothes in the matrix
it ha a separate dna from the mother it ha a separate immune system from the mother it ha a separate heartbeat from the mother it ha separate organ from the mother the argument that it is not a human life suggests that because it relies on the body of the mother for survival it can not be viewed a an individual life with constitutional or even basic human right that is the weakest argument because the same could be said for any vulnerable human especially baby face it that is a baby and abortion is murder it not an opinion it a fact
america just need to stop voting republican and the problem would be solved
mindblowing to me a a german to appoint anyone for life in such a position of power with no good fail safe to prevent abuse of power
biden need to expand the scotus to 11 andor we need to impeach clarence thomas for bribery which we already 100 have factual evidence of and investigate kavanaugh who wa never properly vetted and screened this is not partisan those are fact
the hypocrisy of this court is beyond belief first of all two of the justice position should have been appointed under obama and bidenusing a rule that mitch mcconnel set up and then only abided by the rule when it helped him get two more seat the fact that they seated a justice a month before biden took office is unbelievable and both of the new justice told congress they would support established law when specifically asked about roe v wade during their congressional interview you would think the supreme court would be an example for everyone to follow instead of being a politically based joke
state with restrictive abortion law with the exception of texas represent le than twenty percent of the national g d p they are welfare state that depend on the well organiced prosperous democratically controlled coastal coastal state for their survival
why is there no way to suspend the court agenda until we get answer also suspend any more case to be taking up
a breach of trust but not see a betrayal of the full citizenship of half the nation
dobbs caus8mg sufferingbut eventually will end the gop expand the court staggered 12 term with all over 12 year getting replaced immediately ethic code with criminal liability
f _ c _ this president biden need to add more
it wa always about power and politics what else wa there
is there money involved
speazy amoral right winger
separation of church and state bible thumpers should not be on the supreme court they are clearly prejudiced
these should not be lifetime position that is obsurd
no justice with the supreme court justice team so very very sad
wrong if you not held accountable to one
i dont even know why we think it ok for men to make decision over a woman body unbelievable
people have been brainwashed by godless people to believe it a choice over a crime
no more supreme court we need super computer that have all our law in it both party feed in their provable fact and the computer can settle the issue with no parole or pardon
two of three democratic power are held hostage by hostile rightwing cultist
thats exactly what it look like looking political i believe these decision should be made by doctor whats the point of year of training taking oath to do no harm when they have hand tied plus bringing the whole god question into the discussion is ludicrous
trust in the u supreme court ha reached a record low and it entirely justified these are some of the most corrupt creature in america when the christofascist member of the court arent imposing their talibanlike doctrine on the american people theyre taking bribe from their wealthy friend their name are smeared in excrement and will be for eternity these people have no doubt convinced themselves theyll be remembered in history but their ego dont allow them to realize theyll be remembered with utter disdain and total loathing for generation to come they think theyre going to be remembered like jefferson when in reality theyll be remembered like aaron burr
this is the fifth video in a day that i heard someone fire alarm beeping that it need it battery replaced
thank you jesus for the jjudges who jknow that and wont appove it a ok
thats crimminal insanity
term limit for justice and repercussion for accepting bribe for decision
settled law wa a confirmation lie by brett and amy who had a settled opinion and vote to overturn roe and lied about it
it werid how the y dont call it a baby but a fetus a latin word why not use the english term baby it because it truth that will make you think of it a one and make i t harder to do to see it a precious sacred little life
disturbing to see that the shallowness of american thinking extends all the way to the supreme court
america treat this a a purely personal issue but it isnt at least not in a wider context the world watch and i know for a fact that most people trusting this supreme court wouldnt get taken for a serious person in many country outside the u only a matter of time until this influence diplomacy
there scared of people showing up at there house and childrens school cant blame em doj violated there right please dont take the job if your gon na cave everyone some freak protest
supreme court is tainted with religious zealot
another genius in new york court too smart to google trump property value great job and great pension we pay for a they look down on u trump
so whats the news on alito and clarence not making public all the lavish gift from billionaire
we have fascist at very level in this country how can the average american defend against
corruption at the heart usa justice it the problem of corrupt political lifetime appointment who are often bribed
amy coney barrett brett cavanaugh and neil gorsuch all said that roe v wade is settled president during their confirmation hearing which amount to purgury
this is all the result of one man lifetime quest to overturn rvw and why he allowed trump to remain president this is evil of the highest calibure all for the sake of ideology in something that ha no benefit or loss to them
no one trust the supreme court anymore
so phantom dark money work behind closed door selling out good childrens everywhere
it the christiancatholic supreme court now and you liberal will henceforth refer to it a such
4 of these judge are clearly not fit for purpose three of them appointed by trump 1 appointed by bush thomas ha shown himself to be a tool of the billionaire he sup with for a long time
b judge there is no fairness in the u system i give no respect to judge choose side
she s maga also so there wa some hidden petty reason i m sure
what this show is that the supreme court is a political entity plain and simple
we cant have a supreme court relisting their vote e it nit right our law are our business also no more lifetime term for them transparency
please leave abortion aside it a shame we have several overtly corrupt crooked individual enacting law that rule our country and society it an absolutely abject situation we take like it should be the norm thomas robert alito and gorsuch should have been investigated tried and put behind bar instead these judge have made their own rule that make them immune to prosecution the rest of the civilized world look at u laugh but feel nauseated
for me the only bombshell from this story is that acb wanted to wait until next session i wa expecting more detail about the actual leak and not the consequence interesting but no bombshell
scotus must have term limit what svotus pulled wa just plain evil
lied from msnbc
why would you need longer than 15 week to make up your mind democrat are sick
lol if whole cemetaries can still cast vote and help the favored politician get elected death should not hinder the supreme court justice ginsberg can still cast her vote dead or alive
anita hill warned about thomas
they need to be shamed every time they show up to court protester need to shout shame shame shame they know what they did and expect u to forget and forgive
it time to add more seat to the scotus bench
alito leaked the decision it not a secret roe wa settled law so there wa no reason to take it up other than to overturn it they all lied at their confirmation hearing before the american people when they promised they wouldnt review roe
the supreme court is a corrupt band of magat supporter they are a clear and present danger to our democracy look no further than ginny thomas by the way clarence how much doe it cost to buy a supreme court justice may be we should ask your owner harlan crow
i have no confidence at all in the u supreme court it need radical change appointee by a panel and term limit to start how is it a good idea to give anyone a job for life
the force that passed all these ban in the wake of dobbs would have worked around if not danced and skipped around a 15week compromise the exception would still be written on air water and sand while the restriction would steelreinforced oak they were horrible in dobbs but scotus wa also explicit do it because we can and talk big about whats to come those two aspect were the only favor they did for reproductive right making it crystal clear they were there to erase progress reason and hope
the supreme court ha too much power in all thing
these corrupt judge need to be removed from the supreme court bribe breaking your oath of office are illegal under the law
you were so close at the end when you suggested barret wa only holding out because she wa being pressured by the other justice that oppose the reversal of roe in fact it the inverse barret is suddenly changing and withholding her vite so get a better deal for herself from the other judge that want to reverse roe remember how much corrupt backdoor donation clarance thomas received and never reported how much you want to bet all those kickback happened during these secret court talk they dont let the public know about corrupt at the highest level and the only thing holding it all together for so long wa justice ginsberg keeping people honest
ginsberg should have retired during obamas presidency she wa very selfish and now woman are dying
why hate black conservative thomas is probably the best supreme justice america ha and if he went on a trip with a rich person so what there friend arent gon na be homeless where do you think the bidens were staying in nantucket
kick out all christian judge no faith should be taken into account with these issue
leak of explosive political decision are never accidental leak are a good way to gauge the likely response by the public when officially announced all good news decision are announced on prime time tv during prime viewing hour in a glare of publicity all bad news is released at 1 minute to midnight on a saturday eveningpreferably during some or other catastrophic event earthquake or hurricane or mass shooting carefully choreographed
rbg wa a remarkable person who led a courageous and honest life and made huge stride for woman and all human that said i wish she had decided to retire early in obamas second term
pack the court
whoever leaked the decision wa for sure someone affiliated with the federalist society and leonard leo the evidence of that is that leo had a party the night before it wa released at his home in maine with a number of big player in the effort my money is on alito from the jump
democrat had 50 year to codify roe and decided it wasnt worth it i blame democrat for our li
imagine having a supreme court the composition of which is dominated by liar
if decision wa made based on culture change and religion heading view your reverting removing right a what the british government did when the first colonist came here for your argument option would have be all allowing of people not history telling u this but human right and civilization history it sad this pushed the nation backwards and looped people die from this stuff only hope and faith something restores the future brighter future forward a one nation
these maga gop justice lied under oath during their confirmation hearing remove them
great reporting by new york time reporter jodi kantor and adam liptak so alito thomas and gorsuch were very excited to get their hand on that case not surprising alito and thomas are the true enemy of woman in america more so than the others john robert legacy will be tainted and he will be seen a a weak chief justice during his tenure the corruption of the court is what he will be remembered for
these people are called judgesha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
it is simple there is no complete sepatation of church and state you guy remember when trump posed with the bible this should tell the influence of the christian religion
sadly the ussc too often strike me a the final mean by which a minority view can be imposed on the majority this is not justice it is tyranny
how robert replaced scalia scalia told obama that obamacare wa unconstitutional obama started to look for a replacement he interviewed robert before scalias death robert agreed to uphold obamacare robert wa easily blackmailed for illegally adopting irish child obama gave scalia one last chance when he flew on scalias plane with scalia to texas scalia again said no obama then had scalia murdered
they are like warwhat are they good fordo we really need a scotus it like they are god can make law that all have to abide by but they in turncan be bought by the highest bidder dont have to be accountable to anyone it is said no person is an islandwell these scotus are continent
attn woman if you want your body to belong to you only vote blue so we have say over our body i wonder whats next will they take
the supreme court ha never been nonpartisan the law is always a reflection of the politics of the people and the supreme court will always reflect the politics of the judge on the bench how is that hard to understand there is no law independent of politics
republican one and all republican are all for personal responsibility and freedom unless we dont approve
the 6 justice pictured above are no le corrupt than a jim jordan it organized corruption in fact
every time you think the u cant be any more of a clown show they go and prove u wrong
it not about abortion it about imposing control over other people it about taking away the right of female next will be the right of woman to vote or the right of black to vote or the right of xxx the movement is about removing the freedom of the constitution away from the people of the governed just take a example the woman in texas who could legally get an abortion due to one of the exception who wa attacked by the attorney general of the state law for the governed not for the elite
these judge are just like trumpa bunch of liar
delay to gain vote and change mind
barrett isnt even qualified to be a justice ginsberg should have left when obama asked her to retire
wah wah wah them some tear there
wasnt it trump it not that hard to figure it out
the most bereft scotus money can buy
703 why is justice samuel alito allowed to collude with bro dude kavanaugh about how they would vote on abortion right alito had already written the outline of how to challenge roe v wade why is he allowed to know how any other supreme court justice will vote
it doesnt look like it about politics and power it is about politics power and most of all money these people are easily bribed and they dont do anything to hide it nothing can be done about it because the people that have been appointed have no moral these are the absolute worst people in the world to appoint to lifetime position where they have power over everyone
very telling that a bunch of old men demonstrate their power by deciding what woman are allowed to do with their body
the behavior of the right wing super majority of the supreme court of the united state ha done more to undermine trust and respect in that institution since before the civil war reform is long overdue
their appointment should not have a political attachment
your viewer are going to find out very soon that youve been lying to themyou know exactly whats going onand who you take your order from your whistleblower have been saying this for a long time
completely pointless clip
222 we already know there wa no debate on how to decide any challenge to roe v wade justice alito had already written the outline of how the supreme court would overturn abortion right that ha been public for year now but our news provider only talk about what is new
jodi wa very good uncanny resemblance to tim roth in a wig though
no surprise that the religious bigot of the myopic regressive robert scotus acted a such it who they are from now on when any dem in congress refers to cheeto mussolini he should do so a der führer
elito leaked it
i didnt need the recap i wish youd have cut right to the story
im not sure what is new news here it wa pretty obvious why there wa a leak and the whole investigation around it a sham is this just confirmation
supreme court of chaos robs million of pregnant woman of civil right by abandoning their sacred duty to protect citizen from unconstitutional state legislative action criminalizing health care this is an autopsy trumputin and his cohort in congress made this happen ripping the seam from the democracy of the united state
they should be impeached instead of biden the took an oath and they stated that roe wa precedent so they broke their oath why else take an oath to the constitution id it written on toilet paper
payback to trump for their appointment
the judge gave in to pressure what a shame for judge who should never let outside influence sway them
for the judge who us the threat of changing her vote from one position to the complete opposite this is a political decision rather than a moral or legal one the leak expose this and expose her immorality obviously she feel no selfblame selfguilt nor selfdisapproval for her own action regardless of whether the country criminalizes abortion or not that is unsurprising since she wa placed on the bench with the other two corporate lapdog kavanaugh and gorsuch to go along with the billionaire house laborer thomas thomas went ten year on the court without speaking a word he wa a monsanto corporate lawyer who decided over their deadly case for american agriculture now the situation is volatile because without abortion the population of unwanted child rise and they become the most likely one to commit homicide so homicide rate will skyrocket in fifteen to twenty year depending on the outcome of this case of course corporate elite would prefer this to distract people from their money and asset collection
so ironic that justice ginsburg who refused to resign during obamas presidency and a pro choice supporter death caused this law to unravel
the fix wa in corrupt supreme court
do not assume this is a change of heart by the various right leaning corrupt supreme judge this is a political move pure and simple the single most contentious issue that will swing many voter in the up and coming election is woman freedom to choose take this issue away and many voter may return to supporting trump a purely tactical decision
it is about politics and power not law and reason the extreme court celebrates the fascist five
a great deal of discussion that ultimately change nothing this is an illegitimate court purpose built for the intent of dismantling 80 year of socially progressive jurisprudence
the pill is not an abortion there is nothing but sperm swimming no viable anything and a man should never be able to decide woman make up over half the population in america and the world equality must prevail
supreme corrupt court doe not see woman a equal human to men thus they took away woman right to healthcare and autonomy over their body and life decision america is much more fascist than we were made to believe notorious rbg worked so hard to finally install woman right to choose and these maga fascist just decided to destroy people life just for control purpose too much nasty religious people in politics that use their faith to suppress people that think differently
you are praising her for voting no on hearing the the case are overthetop she knew it wasnt going to matter this wa her attempting to set boundary amongst her coworkers specifically her party member kavanaugh wa duplicitous at his hearing not a leap to see he would be more so behind closed door
regardless of barretts original stance against taking the case the conservative justice overturned roe for dodd and now woman have to travel over state line for abortion theyre probably proud of themselves believing theyre doing god will i just hope the child baring woman of today keep eye on who took away their right to choose and ability to terminate nonviable pregnancy
who in there right mind would keep these 67 far right judge on the supreme court a im not an american but a my great great great grandfather work which also included numerous work including criminal law and procedure and on education and the science of legislation etc his philosophy of law and theory of jurisprudenceetc wa what his good friend your benjamin franklin took his inspiring model from for drafting the american constitution and i know for one these two gentleman my great greatgreat grandfather and benjamin franklin are watching over america now saying what the devil are these people doing and a few word thrown into their thought the nonsense that these so call supreme court judge are trying to sell you all is disgusting and corruptgreedy little blighter can not wait to see the 2024 democrat win which they have and take all three executive branch and then they will sort you all out thank god you judge took an oath to uphold the law not to breach and or break it thank you these are my humble opinion
only in a banana republic you would expect judge to be appointed by the leading political party instead of a panel of expert sometimes the usa look like one
another fake mainstream mockingbird news channel
funny how certain supreme court justice whove used their federal job of being court employee that have enriched their and family bank account whove certain scj chosen to be knowling in the pocket of dark money influence and bribery by giving luxury vacation buying home and vaction home and paying for schooling for family education and certain action of scj have continualy shown that these certain scj are being corrupted and manipulated either thru blackmail attempt or finicial improvementsthe doj and irs need to do investigation for rico and false tax statement if hunter biden is being investigated by irs a private citizen than certainly by federal employee standard of received vaction vechiles home education these certain sitting judge should also be investigated in the end they are just federal employee and should be held to same standars a other employee action code and ethic across america
the most corrupt white house and doj in history
optic they waited a long time to ban abortion whats another few month
justice barret ha seven child who had the good fortune to be wanted and born into a welltodo family and i do know that the welltodo have existential problem of their own to deal with but not having the financial mean to properly raise a child aint one of those problem 1 the supreme court justice should be at least subject to a limited term of civil service since they are not elected but appointed 2 the justice should always have the everpresent precedent of financial need in mind when a mother to be make the decision to have or not to have an abortion based on her future economic ability to properly take care and be able to raise her child 3 in my personal opinion the u supreme court need to have it buble bursted
there are country that separate all three branch of government president are not allowed to involve themselves in installing anyone legislator have no say in the other branch and the judicial are not appointed but investigated and screened by a body expert in democracy
the suprene court will ruin this country
scotus the dictatorial court would be more appropriate term limit should be mandatory
senator susan collins should not be surprised at being deceived during the confirmation hearing of prospective justice any dismay she may have felt is pointless a the damage ha already been done
this is so stupid amy barrett did not change her vote for any philosophical reason only because voting to overturn roe v wade too soon make her look bad
it is a major disappointment when those selected to ensure that others abide by the law and do the right thing are themselves unable to do the right thing
never again should the supreme court decide against the wish of democrat they will be haunted attacked and slandered until the left influence the outcome to get their way america long known glory downhill moving so far under these woke authoritarian
america continues walking meekly into arm of fascismf
scotus ha no room to talk about breach of trust
two member of the supreme court were appointed because they said r v w wa law they wouldnt support it so shouldnt they be sacked for lying at their interview
before attempting to carry out their obvious agenda the honorable justice would do well to remember that we all know where their home are
her point for changing her vote wa to try to look le guilty she wa never gon na be persuaded periodt there wa no question
and what this prof beyond a shadow of doubt is that the decision of the scotus are strictly political sugar coated with a legalese spin
judgement should be based on the whim of the majority and not on the whim of a handful of mainly white male conservative regarding woman health issue
yea america is on it way of becoming a not a free nation slowly taking the right of it citizen what the politician should do is take the statue of liberty down what a joke
chris i guess you dont have to be objective
crooked clarence thomas ha embarrassed himself and the court it will never be the same it ha lost the respect of the nation
we need to stop allowing judge to come from the bias and completely corrupt federalist society who we know have a blatant agenda
brilliant jodi and adam for your hard workexcellent jobthank you
we should all be ashamed of what ha happened to the supreme court corruption is destroying our country
this is why biden should load the supreme court now
their decision to overturn wasnt based on law it wa based on their own personal view espoused to their supporter down the year it wa politics not law and that show that the scotus is in practical term corrupt
woman who voted republican for decade are to blame a well they couldnt wait to overturn roe it absurd watching the trumpers get excited about thing they dont understand
how can the whole usa be held in the hand of 9 people
a justice who even threatens to change her vote based on a political perception shouldnt be trusted with a scotus position they are there to interpret the law not make it to favor their own priority
the robert court ha abandoned precedent which will allow future court to correct the ruling of this court
the democrat should never again approve a republican nominee justice if they hold a senate majority the duality of the gop handling of garland nomination and barretts appointment is so appalling and ha led to a sc that in no way represents the majority sentiment of over 300m american there no point the democrat acting with decency and civility for future appointment in the face of this
an unhealthy leadership lead to an unhealthy populace
the federalist society knew very well amy would cave without much pressure in spite of her switching vote to hold off taking the case they went ahead anyway and therefore she will now be frowned upon a corrupt and rightly so scotus is corrupted and ailito and thomas
i dont understand how can someone support killing unborn human being
every one of those conservative justice lied under oath saying they would never change roe they all did the second they got a chance why we are allowing any judge to come from the federal society knowing they are corrupt and have a specific agenda it should be common sense not to allow these people to even become judge they are bought and paid for political operative and we appoint them to the highest position and government with lifetime appointment
didnt this exact same thing happen the last time
judge for life
supreme more like trash court
when those of you in the medium continue to describe supreme court justice a accepting gift when everyone watching know that they are being bribed by harlan crowe and leonard leo they are bribe not gift how about the outcry from the medium for these corrupt justice to resign how about the medium asking where is doj fbi here is a thought how about someone in the medium asking merrick garland how is it possible that the one person who ha stolen more top secret and classified document in our history still walk free the man who is the largest threat to our national security walk the street free
just look at these untrustworthy face they creep me out
republican are waging a battle on woman time to take off the glove woman best grow a pair time to shut the bedroom door no pssy for republican shut the front dooron republican
another wild conspiracy theory
for 50 year republican argued that roe should be overturned because it wa a state right issue five second after roe wa overturned they started pushing for a national abortion ban because now none of them believe it is a state right issue
best sc money can buy
which justice doe the vatican have a direct link to
it is about politics the conservative super majority only happened because of politics the investigation about kavanough wa never thorough either alito doe not want to follow moral rule about declaring benefit received it about politics influence and corruption
we all assume it wa arrrogant a alito that let it out so proud of the decision he probably wrote immediately after perjoring himself over this issue to get on the bench he ha just been waiting year for a case that gave him the chance to reverse roe
if ever there wa a time to expand the court to 13 it is now this would have the real effect of restoring faith in the independence of the court and removing the corrupt and corrosive effect of the american heritage foundation that ha hijacked our supreme court for good measure trump corrupt nomination along with mr corruption himself thomas should be impeached and removed from the bench now a in monday morning not a day later
what is the purpose of the supreme court and how doe it function the purpose of the supreme court is to adjudicate conflict and dispute between the state and to resolve petition for redress of grievance when properly legislated law are made by a properly assembled and operated legislature disproportionately affect or otherwise disenfranchise a state this necessitates that the supreme court must be assembled by a consensus choice agreement between the state where every state participates by making a list fixed number of candidate from their own state and the aggregate list of candidate must be reduced to a pool of judge no le than 7 and no more than 9 for 5 judge to be selected by lot starting with the petitioner to hear and decide the dispute or grievance the state must be involved because they have agreed to abide by the decision of the court for their grievance and those decision are final not mutable meaning they can not be changed or overturned by a later court we tend to forget this fact today both in the assembly which is different than replacement for vacancy where the president is required to provide a list of nominee for the state to consider a number and required qualification is determined by the state in the senate a part of their role of advice and consent and established by senate rule for their proceeding and the president too must be chosen by consensus choice with the same requirement for the state themselves to provide a list of all the candidate that will be considered for that purpose through their elector making the president list of nominee also indirectly a choice of the state here is where the supreme court wa originally established by article ix clause 2 of the article of confederation and the only difference established by the constitution of the united state is that the pool of judge will be continually seated during good behavior and the appointment of a chief justice to preside over the court proceeding but not participate in the those proceeding a one of the pool of justice everything else is the same including that all petition must be made to congress a the last resort on appeal not directly to the court and congress is then required to ensure that the petition is properly adjudicated a required by the first amendment of the constitution of the united state aixc2 the united state in congress assembled shall also be the last resort on appeal in all dispute and difference now subsisting or that hereafter may arise between two or more state concerning boundary jurisdiction or any other cause whatever which authority shall always be exercised in the manner following whenever the legislative or executive authority or lawful agent of any state in controversy with another shall present a petition to congress stating the matter in question and praying for a hearing notice thereof shall be given by order of congress to the legislative or executive authority of the other state in controversy and a day assigned for the appearance of the party by their lawful agent who shall then be directed to appoint by joint consent commissioner or judge to constitute a court for hearing and determining the matter in question but if they can not agree congress shall name three person out of each of the united state and from the list of such person each party shall alternately strike out one the petitioner beginning until the number shall be reduced to thirteen and from that number not le than seven nor more than nine name a congress shall direct shall in the presence of congress be drawn out by lot and the person whose name shall be so drawn or any five of them shall be commissioner or judge to hear and finally determine the controversy so always a a major part of the judge who shall hear the cause shall agree in the determination and if either party shall neglect to attend at the day appointed without showing reason which congress shall judge sufficient or being present shall refuse to strike the congress shall proceed to nominate three person out of each state and the secretary of congress shall strike in behalf of such party absent or refusing and the judgment and sentence of the court to be appointed in the manner before prescribed shall be final and conclusive and if any of the party shall refuse to submit to the authority of such court or to appear or defend their claim or cause the court shall nevertheless proceed to pronounce sentence or judgment which shall in like manner be final and decisive the judgment or sentence and other proceeding being in either case transmitted to congress and lodged among the act of congress for the security of the party concerned provided that every commissioner before he sits in judgment shall take an oath to be administered by one of the judge of the supreme or superior court of the state where the cause shall be tried well and truly to hear and determine the matter in question according to the best of his judgment without favour affection or hope of reward provided also that no state shall be deprived of territory for the benefit of the united state
it wa not very smart of the supreme court now this political decision work against them their ally
god forbid a woman should have the right to choose for herself afterall the bible tell man she belongs to him misogynistic bullsht no man will ever accept anyone telling him what he can and can not do
fed up with most of the member of the supreme court they should all be investigated all of them to prove they are not corrupt trump appointee are the worst and thomashe need to go away
listen roe v wade never gave a woman the choice to have or not have an abortion never the way the decision read give the woman dr the athority to make the decision wether to terminate the pregnancy or not over a short time doctor would just go along with the woman choice not because she had the right but because it make billion of dollar every year abortion isnt cheap and alot of money is made from the sale of the placenta etc ruth ginsburg state the decision should have gone back to the state of mississippi simply because some state are very liberal and some for example in the bible belt are very conservative the decision wa never implemented correctly in the first place to bad
so if im understanding beer boy wanted to lie to the public
the reporter looked the part
will investigate this but the the corruption that happens what a joke have no faith in the supreme court anymore
there need to be term limit on sc judge this in it for life thing now with two relatively young federalist spell difficult time ahead i suspect
the republican majority supreme court wa created to make law those law republican elite wanted but r too unpopular for congress who can be voted out to pas wout losing or risking their seat american voter need to wake up weve had a republican supreme court for at least the past 150yrs which would not be possible if we were a democracy the republican supreme court is also created to overturn or weaken any dem policy that doe manage to pas we saw the same thing around 19331970s when fdr and dems were passing the bill we needed given the great depression at first the republican supreme court wa oberturning or weakening every bill fdr got passed until fdr who had large enough margin in congress threatened to expand the court only then did the republican supreme court moderated their viewsdecisions im not sure this farright supreme court would change wthreats even if they did dems deserve a turn to have the majority on the supreme court and majority among the entire judiciary we need to be electing more fatleft and left dems whenever possible we need a landslide election for a farleft dem president landslide presidential election r the only election that result in more significant change fdr a farleft dem won 4 landslide election wdems winning the majority of local statestate legislature and federal government minus the judiciary that wa a clear message to all government official that the voter wanted change and the change fdr wa bringing we maintained fdr policy from 19331970s that all ended when voter foolishly fell for reagan a then farright republican wa landslide election weve been on reagan policy most of the time since 1980 it those republican policy that have brought u to where we r today a long a we elect enough gop candidate to either give the gop majority or to have divided government where when the minority of time dems did win majority in the house senate and wh little significant change occurrs bc dems in purple district r concerned about losing their seat and we have divided government where about 50 want demprogressive policy and the other 50 want farright dictatorship aside from a landslide election of a fatleft dem we must get margin large enough to expand the court and carry that out which mean the ppl have to apply massive pressure until it done
horrible reporting on the part of msnbc chris hayes need to either go or return to journalism school at the very least he need to take note from jodi kantor she wa the only real journalist in that entire conversation
forced birth is a religious ideology and a such illegal a per the first amendment first sentence all who voted in favor over overturning roe ha violated their oath
quarreling about word is worthless rejoice that your name are written in heaven luke 1020 keep reminding god people of these thing warn them before god against quarreling about word it is of no value and only ruin those who listen do your best to present yourself to god a one approved a worker who doe not need to be ashamed and who correctly handle the word of truth avoid godless chatter because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly their teaching will spread like gangrene 2 timothy 21417 what a friend we have in jesus by joseph m scriven 18201886 what a friend we have in jesus all our sin and grief to bear what a privilege to carry everything to god in prayer o what peace we often forfeit o what needle pain we bear all because we do not carry everything to god in prayer have we trial and temptation is there trouble anywhere we should never be discouraged take it to the lord in prayer can we find a friend so faithful who will all our sorrow share jesus know our every weakness take it to the lord in prayer are we weak and heavy laden cumbered with a load of care precious savior still our refuge take it to the lord in prayer do thy friend despise forsake thee take it to the lord in prayer in his arm hell take and shield thee thou wilt find a solace there lord jesus god is love joy hope peace
shiny object what did trump do now
robert corrupt supreme court that is the most activist court in the history of the u
the disingenuousness of alito is the most offensive of all we all remember how he wa pointedly questioned about the status of roe during his confirmation and he kept saying that in his opinion it wa a matter of firmly settled precedent his insincerity is breathtaking
the only reason roe wa overturned is the far left and gen z either voted for trump or jill stein or stayed home to protest hillary and elected trump in 2016 and the crazy thing is they are doing it again in 2024
and all robert is worried about is who leaked it ridiculous
thank you court stoping murder baby win
amy ha done so much for other woman
brittany watt and kate cox are what happens when woman reproductive health are decided by republican incels and wannabe commander
the supreme court is nothing more than a political action committee go figure
they will at least uphold the appeal court ruling on the abortion pill they will probably have 6 vote for that but it possible they will ban it completely theyll have 4 for sure alito thomas gorsuch and barrett
supreme court justice how dare someone act unethically now let me take this call from a rich friend giving me an rv free money and a luxury vacation
the power of this group is frightening and make the usa look so corrupt and backward why would you allow anyone a lifetime appointment in such a body
so you cant confirm that the leak wa definitely alito right got it
i think all of the supreme court justice who stated that roe wa established precedence indicated that they would not overturn roe during their confirmation hearing should be impeached
is the entire u experiment just potemkin scenery
they lied to u amen
half of the justice lying under oath to get the job wa a breach of trust
every justice who voted to overturn roevwade and stated it wa accepted case law during their confirmation hearing should be impeached and removed since they lied under oath
im sorry how doe justice exist in a forum where the decision maker make decision based on their own personal bias supreme court justice should be chosen on their ability to be impartial anything other than that is not justice
tho oscar go to judge of the supreme court
i am a practicing catholic and a rabid pro choice woman it is my choice no one should interfere
my guess would be a clerk with principleswhich the court did not pose
could someone please tell me how a scotus judge can be allowed to work until she dy and apparently cant be thrown out
i think we should be really honest once for all this country is very much corrupt a any other countrylets stop this fantasy narrative according to which the usa is a great country
well somebody in the court need to be investigated that part is true
if the supreme court can reverse roe it can reverse anything no one should get used to their right _ mary ziegler the atlantic democrat need to expand the size of the supreme court from 9 to 13 to break it 63 conservative majority hold asap
i really hope that you guy discus that the reasoning wa that the science had changed since the first decision come on be journalist
save you time nothing new useless
no surprise thomas is full steam ahead all those financial favour sound like mafia bribing tactic from the 60 impeach him
if court have right to abortion decision then we should have right on how much the neighbor eats or drink or wear it the same logic
people in their right mind are lefty never vote republican againall the way
the supreme court is staffed by politician masquerading a judge it shameful it wrong it need to be changed increase the number of judge to 12 like a jury in the past and give the chief justice a casting vote
supreme court nor politics have no place making a decision over a woman body this is a decision between a woman and her doctor the majority of people making such decision isold men senior citizen
my theory is that it wa one of the conservative justice who leaked it to damp the outrage when the decision wa to officially announced
850 so without the leak the decision would have been favorable to woman having right to their body i guess we know who messed it up
call it what it is court of bribery the justice that are in there now wa more a test on how much money is a chosen verdict cost edit also not the first time kavanaugh lied about doing something at a minimal morally wrong if not illegal in court
the supreme court is a good example of our entire country being corrupt it about politics and power not law and justice
i think the biggest thing that we should not forget about these justice is that they lied each under oath were specifically asked about roe v wade they all said that it wa considered settled law they said that knowing full well that they were lying they were intending to up end settled law this turned the supreme court from a judicial body into a political one yet no one want to address the fact that basically they had committed pergery to get their job and now we know they were given their job to do exactly that they were chosen by the federalist society because they were known to be willing to lie in order to achieve the highestranking court in the land with the help of the federalist society in my opinion this single act ha discredited the whole institution once you lie you can not ever be trusted amy barrett is the worst of them because she professes christianity the 10 commandment clearly state thou shalt not commit false witness so she isnt even a true christian she ha lied before her god
absolutely crazy for the nyt writer to ask the audience what is the meaning of barrett switching her vote with no answer isnt that your job a the reporter to find and deliver that answer
all trump nomination should be recalled
omg reporter interviewing reporter this is a story about a story seriously is this all we have left there no real news anymore
the second the dobbs decision came out i lost all regard for the supreme court now when they come out with a ruling it mean absolutely nothing to me june 24 2022 wa the day the supreme court invalidated itself forever in my eye if they can so easily see me a le than human then they think they can take whatever they want from me and quite frankly thats not a country i want to live in
the country is past the leak this is another distraction by the sc
we cant have abortion in america who else will go to war and work crap job
i wouldnt wish my life on anyone that is why i am pro choice if youre not responsible enough for kid you shouldnt have them republican have no plan to take care of anyone but themselves let alone all those child they want to force to life to serve them not god
jodi kantor ha a brilliant mind omg
term limit on the supreme court
we all know who did it supreme court justice thomas
i still cant forgive ginsberg for not getting off the stage when she should have i also cant forgive sandra day oconner for leaving when she didand she deeply regretted it a soon a she saw who her successor wa alito regardless of the republican malfeasance in how they have refused to honor any ethic or precedent while stacking the court the liberal wing ha had a coupe of epic own goal that have added 2 hard right wing justice that absolutely didnt need to be there
a breach of trust wa reversal of a law because of religious indoctrination
not only in america but in america poor free world
the conservativ supreme court scotuses have deceived the american citizen
we need to pack the court with ethical judge
leader around the world are asking their citizen to raise their birth rate our government is forcing u to raise ours why
corrupt scotus doesnt know the constitution say freedom of religion no law based on one religious opinion are constitutional when will the medium say those word
republican supreme court judge corrupt liar all
i hope they barrett least regret her vote now i hope she get down on her knee and prays fervently to her god to forgive her and i hope he doesnt
so nothing to do with we the people just a handful of old folk worried about what their co worker thinksmh
this is the beginning of the end of scotus they have declared their corruption and made their ruling illegitimate they have made themselves nothing by the abuse of their power even a powerful group can delegitimize their power and authority by abusing it flagrant abuse of power and obvious corruption ha a corrosive effect on the root of the body politic scotus may continue to exist in some form but they have destroyed the basis of their authority which is not the constitution but the citizen belief in the idea of the fairness and impartiality of scotus the constitution is an important document but all government exist due to the consent of the people once belief is destroyed and it is the inevitable corrosion of the power begin
the entire american system of judge being political is moronic the british system ha nonpolitical system for judge which is a million time better people in the u cant get a fare trial because the political position of the judge decides whether someone will be found guilty and not whether someone ha broken the law what law are should be decided by people who are elected not unelected like these judge this is undemogratic
all this behind the scene politicking between just the justice show how little they consider or care about the purpose of their job like them being so concerned about public perception of themselves and when or how long they should take before taking any specific case and all this it doesnt serve their appointed position or the country
the current supreme court is illegitimate
i just want to thank the scotus because if it werent for this european country especially france would not have thought of enshrining abortion right in the constitution
homeboy wearing the leather jacket ha got a 5 oclock shadow then it spoke it is a pronoun look it upso now i must be respectful im sorry it
today scotus changing how america view the courtas supremely corrupt arrogant narcissistic and devoid of meaningful consistent value
there is congressional testimony sam alito the fascist witch hunter general wa the leak what did mark meadow burn what did donald j trump sell to whom
from president downwhy do we allow people over retirement age to be in position of power
the last two justice will be held accountable long after the others are no longer defining law
corrupt
this is truly disgusting thomas acb kavanaugh ailito and robert should be removed alone because of lying at their confirmation hearing and by taking bribe scotus justice are not above the law
scotus corruption a bunch of people who wear black robe deciding the fate and right of any woman her body her life her choice
supreme court wont vote for anything unless there free trip and gift or cash for them lol hahaha
uncle thomas
put them on term limit and theyll know they can either be political hack with their short term ruling or true to be law if not which would be changed once their term end and remembered in history a either political hack or true justice of law
the highest court in the land should not have the lowest ethical standard senator sheldon whitehouse ri
we arent a bunch of partisan hack amy coneybarrett during a speech at the university of louisville mcconnell center while standing next to the honoree mitch mcconnell
drop the trans commenters really hard to watch edit rbg did this zero respect for her selfishness
the supreme court ha no ethic to follow so an investigation into ethic of the leak seems hypocritical to say the least
i dont understand christian being against abortion when the bible support abortion
no one will ever convince me that conservative are actual people with thought and feeling of their own
every republican appointed justice should be in prison for perjury because they all said roe wa law and they would not overturn it lying under oath is supposed to be a crime in america although this court and trump have proven lying to get power is the republican way
i say that a crooked justice is a traitor and should be treated accordingly
yo why doe that guest look like a dude but dressed like a woman
disgusting beyond articulation
the court shouldnt back pedal on people right
window of persuasion there doesnt appear to be any change of opinion to take away an existing right the nyt still playing both sideism
the corruption in the supreme court is mind boggling they have to drag the justice out of the court and fire them and disbar them
i want a public accounting of how many abortion were purchased by every member of congress and donald trump hypocrite
weak reporting they know fullwell who leaked the decision it wa to make sure none of the conservative judge switched their vote because theyd get death threat from their rabid supporter if they did
why is she trying to sugar coat acb stop trying to launder that ideologue
ruth body wasnt even cold
it up to the state to decide abortion abortion is not a constitutional right so abortion it legalillegal depending what state you live in whats the issue
ya ya ya blah blah blah everything is a bombshell or breaking news with all these criminal and yet nothing happens to them so why bother
the u suoreme court is the most fraudulent group of reublican stormtroopers god please add new justice to take the number of justice to 11 they lack any intellectual integrity or honesty disgusting
so this is just proof of hypocrisy from the scotus by the entire right calling kb a political appointee they were just projecting what this court would become a political vehicle for unpopular legislation to pas the amount of hypocrisy from alito saying how democratic controlled state would not abide by his ruling while he allows gop control state to put up the middle finger to scotus decision in the history book this court is going to be seen a both antiamerican and antidemocratic
the breach of trust wa when these robed lying pig said r v w wa settled case law but then overturned it it not the supreme court it the lying cheating hypocritical court
amy coneybarret wa only concerned with her own legacy she is not le reprehensible than originally thought she wa driven by self interest
a a woman with two daughter in their 20 i am very relieved that we do not live in america i feel desperately sorry for woman who live in the gop state these talibanlike medieval state that dictate what woman do with their body it 2023 for goodness sake
and who should we thank for the this mess trump he put three judge on the court who made this nightmare happend
oh surprise the court that wa stolen by the republican under mitch by abusing the system of appointing justice then decided to impose their personal religious view on the american people while being corrupted at it core by billionaire influencers with similar religious view and the way they did that wa even more corrupt and sinister
cavanaugh ha resting punch me face
breach of trust is the court of liar
why no one just say 4 of these so call justice lied to congress and they lied to the people
and then people are blamed for being swept away by conspiracy theory this doesnt bode well because it injured woman across the country and this very much damaged the court
chris used the word jurisprudence in the same sentence a supreme court lol
after the gop stole a scotus seat and five of the justice voted to overturn law they all acknowledged wa settled law in their confirmation hearing i can only see scotus a a kangaroo court at this point and then youve got thomas and alitos indiscretion and clear conflict of interest a well how can anyone respect this body at this point
i already read the nyt article where is the bombshelll about the leak there in the nyt report it even say that no one know who leaked the report still
they scotus justice are 100corrupt because they know they are above the law and they have job for life im starting to feel that dictator such a pukin for example are more trustworthy than american government official why you may ponder because they are honest about their intention to stay in power and keep control over their ppl no matter what they have to do im not saying they are good or admirable by any stretch of the imagination but at least the citizen know whats going on in the mind of their leader american government on the other hand is full of lying cheating corrupt ppl who smile in our face and stab u in our back all while denying everything
when wa the last time a conservative spoke without lying not in my lifetime and im 62
why cant those justice be impeached for lying under oath
is this journalist really trying to tell me that acb had a slight moment of self awareness even though that theocratic nightmare overturned roe anyway thats super gross and disingenuous what do yall mean what is happening they were appointed ng seat wa full on stolen precisely exactly to overturn roe and duhhhh it wa leaked by alitos dinner buddy to cement the vote duh it didnt do the dems any better to leak it just 6 week earlier either way it wa before the midterm
the supreme court ha been bought and those justice that accepted bribe should be in prison
it ha been so long since i heard anything on this srory and of course now it is being drowned out by the horror story coming out s the result of the overturning of roe v wadebut i am glad that people are still looking into this there is clear evidence here that the ethic of the supreme court ha be irreparably compromised the more we hear about this the deeper the rabbit hole go the irony is if robert had managed to push roe v wade to 15 week we wouldnt be in this mess the right would still be trying to push back the date but wed all be naiive and complacent snd letting them continue to do it instead eeve got lindsey grahan saying well what about 15 week and were all like oh no we were willing to go for that but that wasnt good enough for you you had to have a total ban or nothing honestly i dont know why the supreme court hasnt turned on itself yet i dont know how they can pretend to trust each other
didnt this actually happen over a year ago
hey from what you are saying it almost a if the scotus judge are not quite honest
amerca where they celebrate your tt hooter but they regulate your clts scotusss
this is a kangaroo court anyway they all believe in the great white replacement theory
thank mitch mcconnell
ny timesgets it right every time thank you
ginsburg should have stepped down long before she did anyone with any sense know she wa not ruling in her last year definitely not the day she died but she wa a democrat pawn and they used her vote however they chose trump picked out of a list provided to him so a group of people put a list of people they wanted and trump picked his choice of their list ginsburgs selfeshness to stay relevent hurt the democrat no one else the process and life move on i find it ironic a woman is picked to be a supreme court mainly because she wa black and a woman becomes a justice and then for the first time in history of the country we have a leak
this is what happens when you dont have term limit and you dont have justice in the supreme court theyre bigger crook than people on the street but yet theyre allowed to stay there thomas should have been gone a long time along with many others who have been proven to be just a guilty a him
this is collusion political collusion these justice should be tried
oh the divisive left strange bedfellow like joe and kamala bill and hillary or dylan and bud light
i dont buy the argument that the new radical rightwing justice seriously considered going back on their oath to the federalist society cabal to overturn roe it ha been building to this for a very long time a the rightwing theocratic anticonstitutionalists that they are albeit that they claim to be strict constructionists observing plain meaning it wa always clear that they could hardly wait for ginsberg to die why else did they lie openly and operate corruptly during the selection process to get antiroe fundamentalist catholic on the court
double win for the right wing extremist the supreme court ha lost all legitimacy a a fair arbiter which further damage democracy a well a making arbitrary undemocratic decision
how can you have them for life this is why corruption grows in supreme court look at clemens
our notsosupreme court full of corruption and injustice
if trump win in 2024 there could very well be pressure for thomas to resign do he can be replaced with another young conservative judge
everybody ha the right to lifeliberty and happinessexcept an innocentunborn child
rbg had just passed a health screening btw
leoall over this he is
any judge who us their personal belief andor their political affiliation to make a judgment is not being impartial and should not be serving a a judge we have too many on the court now that are doing just that and some are in the pocket of some wealthy people is that being ethical or having any integrity i think it is time for some real change in how they are selected and voted in and having some strict oversight over all their action in fact the way thing are now we need this for all our public servant and not have any political party involved yes the supreme court justice are public servant
i guess coney barrett and kavanaugh were reluctant to take the case up immediately since they had just recently testified that roe wa established law during confirmation hearing just a few month earlier i guess they figured the public memory is very short but in this case the public still remembered they were lying during their confirmation just another in a long line of politicizing the supreme court under john robert who stalled on partisan gerrymandering until wavering justice kennedy retired and gorsuch took the seat merrick garland should have had and they wonder why respect for the supreme court ha plummeted under robert he the head of the judicial branch of the evangelical and corporate controlled republican party not a nonbiased judiciary that respect the constitution and decade old precedent confirmed over the year in judicial decision and of course second guessing what the men who wrote the constitution intended which miraculously always end up being what they want it to be a if james madison could envision civilian weapon capable of killing 20 people in one minute or that massive corporation would control tax and limit the right of worker to exert power through assembling in union originalism is one of the biggest con the court ha foisted on the public since the early 1900s
no ore lie like the new york try imes
it sound like they got even
if you have already taken a side on a case before it happened you dont deserve any official seat nor are you qualified to fill it
i think the supreme court judge should either ride a horse or pedal a bike 35 mile to work each day let see how many of them want to stay after that
they violated the right of every woman and girl in the country they violated their path several lied under oath
this is corrupt kangaroo court dems should get fill the court with more judge to protect this country
oh yeah that leak to rupert murdoch
such a bunch of weirdo on the supreme court get rid of the compromised weirdo
the abortion debate is not about right and wrong it is about cannon fodder and defense industry labor in 1973 we were done with war now war is in the offing
all i can say is i told you sothey just want to sort how to take right away and this wa just the beginningand yes they were waiting for her to die change law and they were not going to be transparent with people in this countryand they never will bei guess i am amazed that you were shockedthis is a test run they will look at other right
the justice arent so just
bring back medhi
so all 3 trump appointed justice are liar all 3 lied during their confirmation hearing
why tf didnt she retire when she should have rbgs arrogance undid her good entirely and aided their evil shame
the current supreme court is one big breach of trust
supreme court must to stop biden to help isreals war
you know what wa a breach of trust overturning roe v wade
it ok if trump becomes president there will be no supreme court because dictatorship dont need them
i wonder how many woman have died through illegalback streetabortions since roe v wade wa rescinded
the fact that a republican appointed judge to a supreme court already ha an agenda on an issue like this is bulshit
the current court is illegitimate we all know it
it been pretty obvious to me from the beginning that alito or one of his staff leaked the draft to have exactly the effect that it caused ending any chance to change any vote
if you are going to allow abortion up to 151620 week there shouldnt be any restriction at all woman past those date needing abortion are for medical reason but men would never understand that
although they can not expose who leaked personally i suspect justice thomas or someone on his staff wa the leak but it wa just a suspicion and we do not convict someone on suspicion
al franken said he belief it wa samuel alito who leaked it to seal the vote ahead of the final voting just a suggested here and since they never found the one who leaked it this make perfect sense
breach of trust more like an eye opener to the inner corruption and political orientation of the highest court and it s melding with interest forget precedent what rabbit hole is this country sinking into right won right taken
the only people who support the killing of the unborn are godless people
government ha no say over the body of a pregnant woman but doe have unlimited power over the body of everyone else democrat
why dont we ever talk about the fact that trump acknowledged in a medium interview in the 80 that hed paid for 3 abortion of girlfriend
a breach of trust from a radical activist hack who protecting corrupt sob repugnican operative in the scotus reich winger are _so_ lucky hypocrisy isnt lethal
conservative will not be happy until they ruin our nation
when you fear integrity and accountability you are not the good guy
the religious right are trying to impose their religious belief on to the people of america separation of church and state
without hate or fear in your heart the republican party cant control you
the supreme court is disgusting and a joke ive given up on our country it hard for me to feel proud of my country anymore why doe any count have a right to tell me what to do with my body my neighbor or friend is prolife and thats great but why should they decide for me their belief maybe i dont believe in their church of choice but should i be forced to go to their church because thats their belief
there is no honor or objectivity in the supreme court it just another group of politician
in canada justice have a 25 year term limit and must retire at 75 just sayin
it no longer about justice and reason it about power this is our theocratic present with the gop dark money scotus
i honestly believe the gop wa paid to tear their own country apart
republican are liar these liar are imperial legislator masquerading a impartial judge
robert is a disgrace a chief justice and he too old to grow a pair
so am i understanding that during the preleak time that it wa actually possible one of the conservative may have been considering upholding the roe v wade decision if it wa a private votedecision but the leak forced them to do what they were being pushed to do by upending it which seriously make me question if it come from one of the conservative judge group i got that with how the woman wa talking through the video or im wrong and it still likely one of the progressive side that did it in hope itd shame them in order to keep precedence i just dont see any true conservative belief in how that court handle it them and the republican party are trying to force a political viewstanceopinion that is gradually going away but use tactic and behavior that doesnt feel conservative or morally right that real conservative speak of lot of that side are fake who dont really believe in conservation or whatever they say recent example would be the mom for liberty group founder revealed to have done nonconservative bedroom activity theyre all hypocrite and liar
for some reason i can just imagine the justice looking in the mirror in the morning saying i am the law like judge dread
i mostly hate feminist but on this one even i cant disagree this is just pure misogyny absolutly disgusting these people are not christian
why exactly is this news a bombshell
ginsburg said year ago she truely believed that roe v wade wa in orrectly adjudicated and she believed it would eventially be overturned
i wish i had access to the article because i didnt follow this
cavanaugh is a right wing zellot
scotus is bought and paid for america is over
to me i think it obvious that ginni thomas is the leaker
they have destroyed an entire branch of government
obviously they knew all along exactly what they intended to do each and everyone totally lied during their confirmation nice to know that the right wing justice on our highest court in the land are just simply liar
this supreme court is illegitimate expanding the court is the only option
this is what it look like men want to take away woman right
just wait until the bought and paid for supreme court give the koch family all they ever wanted to destroy the u government once the corrupt justice rule that the u government can no longer regulate anything the country will grind to a halt
1 year delay doesnt seem like an evolution of the law it still very much feel political
turning woman into secons class citizen is far more evil and enraging and horrible than who leaked the draft
rbg wa selfish obama wa in the wh and should have had an appointee ginzberg had had many close call and wa obviously working on fume concerning her health yet she clung to power leaving u with barrett it difficult to get over her hubris her belief that only she could do it extending her time in the sun i wa angry
impeach all republican trump for prison 2024
leaktimed release to the press to keep people distracted
scotus guaranteed a lifelong job with power since 1789once a human get power u find out what their all about everybody ha a personal agenda i just cant believe that it took 234 year for the dirty laundry to be revealedthe law of the landi hope the corrupt judge that have already been identified get removed from the benchthere are term for political office and so should there be term of 2 4 or 6 yr at the most a a youth i constantly haunted my parent about the scotus setup and how could this be a part of a democratic society and i think i got my answer not what we have been led to believe is all good please fight to save our freedom vte
so they agreed with rbg that roe v wade wa bad law and should be decided by state
abortion is murder point blank
the amount of comment supporting murdering innocent life is crazy evil
thanks so much for doing this piece chris
four of the conservative justice on scotus are proven liar this court is usa supreme arbiter of law such is the ethical standard of usa
roe roe roe your vote gently down a stream merrily merrily merrily merrilyabortion right were but a dream
she also wrote decision prior to her appointment that clearly show she supported anti abortion
this go to show how desperate the labour party is
i thought this clickbait wa about the scotus leak nothing in this really focus on the leak
imagine if american woman were legally allowed to forego motherhood through abortion and adoption without being legally responsible yet american men are unable to legally forgo fatherhood without permission from woman and are forced to be legally responsible double standard and female privilege are fun kid hand off woman body hand off men body
too much power for too long with no control lead to corruption
the labour party is looking for vote trying to rile up the woman vote the labour party is lame and disgusting msnbc you are disgusting
this is sickening now that we are now hearing this how disgusting
scotus acting like theyre god the scotus is officially a partisan sectarian political institution that is strongly almost totally bought and paid for by far far right corporate religious donor reverse all trump nominee because 1 trump ha been impeached and stand charged with extremely serious crime including fomenting an insurrection against the usa capitol newly elected biden government both brett kavanagh and amy barrett lied under oath which surely is impeachable and warrant being sacked
msnbc ha no credibility
the supreme fraud these court traitor are bought off by the koch brother and other billionaire neo conservative shame on them they need to be impeached convicted and ousted
and people wonder why conspiracy theory are so prevalent
should have been investigated yesterday is robert trying to save facejust think they may be hearing trump immunity claim this is very scary the decision wa political period
inappropriate sound like a job for thomas
so much for basing any decision on the law
typical nyt apologist
enough bsnbc who freaking leaked the report why is this so hard who leaked the report who leaked the report who leaked the report who leaked the report who leaked the report
the supreme court is corrupt how can we trust judge who cant be held accountable or punished in any way thomas along should be removed for working with billionaire
scotus best supreme court money can buy
those very white people will nit lije bsbies being left on thier door step let one of thoer daughter get pregnant d and c nice and legal
imoit wa intentionally leaked before the actual decision wa announced to quell the potential backlash and unrest that would have occurred if wa announced on a special report on tv
the supreme court and therefore the entire justice system is tainted and untrustworthy it is shocking how low the united state ha fallen fact are argument dont matter the supreme justice have already made up their mind they only want to get appointed in order to impose their will and turn woman into forcedbirth womb for the state
robert is a hayseed travesty of a justice
this sound like a big nothing an appeal wa made by a state and the justice considered how to proceed they tried to persuade one another something that happens in most case a far a delaying the case and not telling this to the public this is up to them to decide scotus will take up a case and decide it when they decide it nothing super unusual going on here
defund the supreme court they no longer represent justice
joe bidens hole family must stand trial
look at all the baby killer thristy for fetal blood in the comment sick satanic
if it wa a liberal justice it would of 100 been reported to the press thats how you know who leaked it
the people who invoke the bible or buy bull a i call it in this debate cherry pick to extreme and it is usually men who decide about woman right yeah not good
how old is this bombshell
the leak is a breach of trust but lying through your teeth about your intention before the committee deciding if you should be appointed isnt a total breach of trust to the entire country
we have the vote now we just need to fill in the law
this is a what about is is im and no one give a flying fuxk about it it should been at the state level always full stop
the supreme court process in usa ha zero to do with justice
a nation divided amongst itself can not standthis knowledge ha been known since before biblical time this is why the president is the man to encourage and foster a united citizenry not to cause great chasm of hatred and separatism mixed in with bigotry racismfascism and fantasy of being the supreme leader for life we got what the elector wanted again what could go wrong ha any discussion ever come up a to why those elector gave their vote to bad orange impossible to believe they might just do it again indictmentsfelonies case on trial it seems none of this can stop a nihilistic scenario sure to take place if current poll become reality
who else thought they clicked on the wrong video
how the politician treated rbg after her death wa nothing short of criminal
it wa a predetermined verdict in search of a case
ok the stock market is now the highest ever and did not plummet like trump projected and biden created 14 million job more then the last 4 republican president together and oil production is far far higher then under trump still we need to support trump a trump is the only one who will join the russian alliance of russia iran cuba venezuela north korea and nicaragua we need to become close to these country and stop our western alliance also only trump will support the top 1 income of the usa also woman right went out of hand
i feel these justice decided on their own religious belief and not on our constitutional right i feel in doing so they gave permission to state to become dictorial over woman and caused pain and suffering to woman who are being forced to carry unviable fetus and in some case forced to surrender their own life they are threatening doctor to lose their license if they make decision that are best for their patient brett kavanaugh and amy c barrett have proven themselves untrustworthy because they said before our country they would not overturn law that have already been established such a abortion then president trump revealed he would use the supreme court to pas law according to his voter religious belief instead of our constitutional freedom all three of these person have proven to be untrustworthy a well a unconstitutional this leak is important i feel the motive is to show how amy c barrett wanted to deceive the people by rejecting the case but knowing full well she would vote based on her own religious belief and not our constitutional right this leak prof how untrustworthy this conservative scotus is and even more important to point it out due to the upcoming vote on whether a president is immune from criminal prosecution
the supreme politician of the united state presented the reversal of roe v wade wa an opinion based on reasoning that the court should not make the law but only interpret them law are the responsibility of the congress or the state this reasoning is a complete hypocrisy while qualified immunity is still being applied it wa created by the supreme court and is used in state where no law exist for or against if the court revers roe it should also remove any use of qualified immunity where no state or federal law are applied after all the court doesnt make law mg
the supreme court is not relevant anymore they cant be trusted and should be disbarred
it wa alito
amy barrett and clarence thomas are disgusting piece of filth cavanaugh also
a key factor in trump getting the 2016 gop nomination wa he agreed to stack scotus this wa pivotal in him gaining the nomination this leak is motivated by many of the lawyer working in the court who respect the law above politics and are disgusted at the stacking of the court they see justice a being one eyed they have had enough alito is not a judge he is an agent
what is hard to understand it back to each individual state i dont really understand what everyone is so upset about if you want an abortion go to the state where it legal you dont have to broadcast to the world what youre doing im sure the abortionist wont tell most people want to vote on it we are a republic voting count
there wa no true window of persuasion the sc is corrupt and the hubris is outrageous
we cant say for certain who leaked it but we know the deliberative process wa at play and then the leak come along and those effort are hopeless so alito
ahh yes justice barrett the hero for not wanting to take it earlier upon giving the optic that she might be considered to blame for the law of roe versus wade being rescinded so is this what msnbc is now you guy now celebrate the mediocracy of politics
barrett only voted no because of political reason at 1st the next term she would have been fine with it her no vote wa just to make it look good shes no hero here
where doe the judicial oversite committee stand where there is evidence of compromised justice being bought and sold which subject the scotus to rule on matter based on personal emotion while withholding logic
unelected king and queen with supreme power for life doe that should like democracy to you
maybe president who didnt win the popular vote shouldnt pick judge or remove the entire process from partisanship
this is a gross anomaly it will be overturned the only question is how long it will take
talibangelicals woman are livestock in these people eye
you know who leaked it the same one that leaked last time start with an a
scotus is a corrupt institution a great country can not remain great when the justice system is corrupt
it not about strategy it about the law something scotus ha completely forgotten about
we just dont know here some more worthless discussion on the fact that we just dont know
strange this woman claim she is able to read justice mind get that woman a crystal ball
hmm did the leak come from the alito camp
the person who leaked this information is at least lacking integrity but more likely absolutely a criminal and got paid big buck from biden admin and democrat clear this absolutely benefited bidens corrupt administration
sure is interesting of him how all of the rightwing bot farm are targeting progressive channel and comment section and youtube doe nothing about it
murder ha never been a right
woman is not too smughuh know it all another one
any and every court authority hinge on perception of it neutrality
this show that the supreme court is now nothing but extremist conservative politics and not actual law and order this nation no longer ha a system of law and order and once again it thanks to right wing republican conservatism a it all about power grabbing and destroying democracy burning the constitution and setting up a russia style autocracy government under only right wing politics
political judge have lost all credibility the day is coming when they will be ignored and even pushed aside
all the scotus did wa took roe v wade out of federal hand and handed it down to state by state law
i got a question if we are over taxed under represented and cant choose our law what is the point of that system we have reached a new low if justice are pocket judge
only trump supreme court can fix this
blatantly political right wing justice who were hellbent on an outcome instead of following jurisprudenceand weve learned that john robert is not up to the heft and import of his job
the supreme court ha become a twisted and corrupt a the current gop and taking away our faith in justice the lunacy of the republican congress the maga cult is all based on lie trump ha the record for more lie than any politician in america history to see our country go down this path is disgraceful and aggravating lock trump up and shut him up
if some leftist clerk thought the leak would save roe and the leak cemented the positionsthen that asshat shot themselves in the foot the prolife side should thank them if they are ever caught
with the courtsroe decision the court lost even the pretense of being impartial the court ha become an extension of the republican party
omg what a painful segment why did this steal 10 minute from my life can i have my 10 minute of life back what is the point of all of this who care about the normal back and forth of decision making of the 9 most powerful people in america they are judge they talk among themselves they have to discus their opinion and the language that go into it what is the point what is the purpose of this
scotus sick crook onanist theocrats undeserving simpleton
msnbc is a domestic enemy collusion to highest treason
this is thanks to mitch and ruth for robbing obama of two more pick
whats the bombshell pat the it
the deck wa stacked when wealth began to be concentrated scotus ha been focusing on their grand theory forgetting the life of 90 of american the one without money to pay for lawyer donate to politico
cant supreme court justice be impeached
overturning roe led to the open corruption today with thomas and alito using deceit like this paved the way by introducing political consideration
black get the most abortion win win
abortion isnt a guaranteed right under the constitution and roe wa poorly decided challenged by fetal recognition a human by lower court especially in homicide prosecution increasing fetal viability during gestation further weakened roe abortion assigned to the people to decide under the tenth amendment with legislator answerable to constituent is best
we have fell into the mindset that killing our baby is a personal right this is an immoral way of thinking and it ha been politicized where people dont even realize how it ha marginalized to an extent to where they are playing god and that each fetus is a fleshand blood human and the act is murder stand in a mirror and tell yourself that you were once a fetus
everyone forgets that there are 9 supreme court justice 5 were nominated by republican president and 4 were nominated by democrat president the ruling wa 6 to 3 with judge robert voting against overturning roe v wade that made the vote 4 republican justice for and 1 against where did the other 2 vote come from roe v wade wa overturned because 2 democrat appointed justice voted yes everyone is blaming the wrong the wrong group it wa overturned because the democrat justice voted yes to overturn it wake up the democrat dont care about woman right they only care about controlling power think of how much money the democratic party ha made pushing this issue
impeach the whole supreme court and replace the with term limit and congress interview of appointee with a special election to be approved by the public we vote for the supreme court along with the president every 4 year they cant get any more corrupt
i love at 650 how jodi kantor say yeah i see what youre saying but here another perspective
great the right ha cheated to get in the court they have been taking bribe while on the court now we hear that they dont care about law because they are more equal than the 215000000000 people in the country who think abortion should be available
so it probably alito who leaked it
why cant she tell u who leaked it doe she know who did what happened to the republican investigating relating to the leak
msnbc save my political sanity confirmation bias sometimes sometimes not but my tribe
theyre already corrupt might a well get paid for it
remember trump fault he put them in there he took our right he is proud of it thank god i live in new jersey
we can only hope that their action have caused irreparable damage to the uterus annexation party
tool and fool total b the supreme court wa great when democrat held a majority how interesting and hypocritical
dont complaint bring your rearend to voting booth
the sc is bought and corrupt af
we have no trust in the supreme court and the liar too
the frog boiling in the pot it always the fascist who tell you that nothing is wrong always
it wa ginnie
there are so many useful leftist idiot out there in the u i mean sad reality
i still on the fence with the newest judge and the leak judge jackson especially her being so liberal in her confirmation hearing still on the fence but i sway with jackson saying or talking about it with someone she knew would leak it out
they had this thing in the bag they were just waiting for the right moment to strike vote blue
dirty deed and bad faith are just business a usual for the phony on the religious right
i personally dont care anymore the democrat let this happen to raise money they could have prevented it and they refused just so they could us it a a marketing slogan
after all these year we are finding out justice is not blind
case are decided by powerful people behind the curtain
amy coney barrett said when questioned in the senate hearing for her nomination roe v wade is the law of the land i would not change that so she and kavanaugh lied which is illegal i thought
prolife people will never convince prochoice and vice versa never even if you could prove when life began prochoice people wont care there will never be all one way or all the other you either compromise or we keep going back and forth the supreme court wa right until congress pass a federal law it is a state right issue stop blaming conservative justice for basing law on the constitution that is their job and they ruled on the case before them not the hypothetical in their nomination hearing there neds to be a compromise on a federal level and put it to bed enough is enough msdnc stop acting a the moral authority you could not be more bigoted and biased
alito did it himself to torpedo the compromise breyer and robert were lobbying for it also reminded me of how rbg undermined roe by hanging on when obama could have made an appointment had she stepped down
so if these hooker said they wouldnt reverse roe but now reversed that are they not impeachable
remember justice serve based on good behavior justice are not guaranteed a lifetime appointment thats one reason why scotus dont want an ethic standard
is that a man or a woman
always remember that everyone who voted for trump in 2016 is responsible for this
expell clarence tomass now put him in prison now
ginny thomas
just because something is immoral that doesnt mean we need a law for it
dont mistake pro birth and pro life two very different thing
im going to send them a couple of buck see if they will grant me immunity from speeding ticket
the most pitiful thing you will see on youtube these day is feeble old joe biden asking people to send him a few buck for his reelection campaign the man is decomposing right before our eye have his family no shame
remember no judge or attorney general ever took up trump argument regarding the stolen election even the highest court took a knee shame on them then they said he lost 57 attempt when none of them even looked at all the evidence
abortion is murder abolish all form of murder
guess the supremes lack of ethic isnt a breach of the public trust
anything to distract people from the real issue of corporate dominance of society
over 60 million child murdered by abortion and these two are talking about politics
i think the supreme court need to go
are their confirmation hearing done under oath they all lied about the support of overturning roe it settled law i feel betrayed
back when the first leak happened i said there were 13 more decision than were written more than 3 year before acb wa put on the sc she wrote these decision a decade ago to destroy right in america the person who leaked the 14 decision installing a sharia law government and religious law they were very clear with the people that they gave copy they told them when they could release the other decision before they are handed out but there were other note that she wrote about making sure they dont take away birth control before they have a majority in the house and senate and they have a republican president the conspiracy is super clear in her note that go back a decade the big question is who got these file off her laptop this ha to be someone who had intimate access to her most likely someone who wa in her house a lot i believe she know for sure and i think the sc know now who it is that got the file off her laptop and it is a person in her inner circle and they did not know this person wa not a true believer and they believe in freedom not religious law and is a traitor to her and the other half of the government who want sharia law and ban all birth control and make it a death penalty for anyone who is caught trying to get it some day we will know who the leaker is and it may be one of her kid or her husband
is there anybody still trusting this fraudsters they are lawless and still have the power to do what they want why dont they chance the law in senat or congress well wherever in u law is installed why are they not in prison the whole world know they got paid for their ruling u u now a lawless nation what is it worth
the supreme failure
these new judge are money plant in the supreme court
while i certainly understand it a matter of contention i dont understand where it a right to end a life at it beginning i personally have seen several time where abortion wa used a a form of birth control there are dozen of form of birth control abortion should not be one of them
roe v wade wa decided based on policy preference not what is constitutional supposedly it wa based in a right of medical privacy but homicide wa never subject to 4th amendment protection it a shame that it took strategic planning and politics to allow a correct ruling it should have never taken 50 year
anybody with common sense will not vote for biden
joe biden is a war criminal
they should have this removed and put back a wa a it only hurt republican they have been losing to democrat like crazy ever since and even if trump get to run he will never win because of this a long a abortion is not returned to a wa trump and his gop will lose more and more power
i dont want fake judge in the supreme court these are fake judge
who is upholding the constitutional right to one person
how sad ruth bader ginsburg wa replaced by the nutty amy coney barrett break my heart rbg wa so brilliant
these judicial activist forget they hold neither the purse nor the sword vote organize focus locally but network scotus is like fiat currency it only a powerful a our confidence in it
who invited loki
all three trump judge who were unethically installed swore under oath that roe wa president
can you please stop using the term breaking news and bombshell report for regular news i love your content and i know you guy want click but i cant click every video every day expecting something epic
brit here the questionable justice sic have introduced an ethic code problem is it is like a shark with no teeth
wow jody totally massaged the nuance out of this entire thing such an interesting piece well done
trump the gop fascist corrupt everything they touch
msdnc doesnt know a bombshell from a can of ovaltine
imagine him spouting about breach of trust clown
when the gear of our branch of government become so mired in self dealing they lose sight of the current ethos on an issue abortion and their position in every way departs from evidence based reality what they claim simply doe not happen in the context they say and people know it they also know a judge deciding whats best for a woman health is farcical in every way we know this this will be the course correction thats needed coming from the people question is is it still possible given the gerrymandered state legislature control of mapping and court deliberately buttressing their argument this will be pivotal fulcrum within these time of unimaginable consequence
how can they know any of this when the court and the justice system cant seem to find out who even leaked it
roe v wade wa overturned in exchange for kamala harris being put into office
how can we even trust the supreme court i know i dont
there now teaching law at 1 of those ivy league school imagine that
none of these hypocrite live their religion they only mouth it god is the supreme judge not the supreme court of the united state they dont give a crap about you after you get here unless you have money influence and power they all will have their day of judgment yippee
the court is a facade
it clear that the robert court is corrupt and is not working for the american people we need to hold them to account and put in people who actually care about the well being of american and not just those who bride them
the thief oops sorry justice need to have a term limitsthe biggest thieve with the wife that helped to have trump retain power need to go now
trust in the supreme courtnot any more
same crew who put those fake pipe bomb on january 5th why wont they tell u
without abortion we are livestock who dont own their body ready to have the mark of a beast branded like cattle with fire yikes
i am so blown away a a woman you guy go for it but i know freedom have at it hand off my body and all those that of like mind peace be with you my friend we will get through this very strange time
it a very sad day democrat number one issue is killing baby that baby is alive at conception if dems dont change they will have alot of innocent blood on their hand
none of their business rather it is a woman prerogative shame
ha dumeecratic justice katangie finally figured out the definition of the word woman yet
the case before the the scotus wa not settled because they didnt hear it previous order are settled unless there is a new case to hear which there wa
the most amazing thing is that people listen to you
god magic took right away from womenwhat a joke
abortion is murdering a human being
this from the same people who consider corporation people it insane
everyone know who the leak wa why wont you say it
it can not be a surprise to anyone that the decision to take the case and the decision on the case to overturn rvw were political literally reverything we do in life is on some level political because we are choosing and making judgement all day every day weighing out what we believe what we think is right or wrong or what is the least bad or the most good with everything and those decision are about our politics in the widest down to the narrowest definition rvw when it wa first decided wa a political choice made by supporter and detractor and scotus at the time there is no surprise here the real question is why are so many gop leader and why is trump and why is doe scotus appear to be so ready to make and force political choice that are not reflective of where most people choice are today what is driving them to make such bad political choice i really dont think the medium ha asked the question widely enough what role ha the slow but progressive change in our climate played what role did the pandemic play what role ha over population played what role ha the migration of people away from poor economy and authoritarian state played in the highly charged situation that the world and the u find itself today are there other are there better choice and is there any ability to change the choice we seem driven to make the medium simply need to do a better job than they are doing by talking about trump 247365 when he is likely only a symptom of much larger problem that need to be addressed
so what doe this mean exactly nothing can or will be done about it
america is tied of these liar all in the fascist republican party that is why america is going vero forevermore until the republican party is gone
i dont understand how a supreme court appointment should ever be a life time appointment they should be removed if not ruling for the constitution or against the people of the united state i believe that the setting president should be able to send a removal to the senate just the same a an appointment
the law is made in your state
this is not rule of law just rule of personal belief and faith both religious and political
waitit look like politics and power hahahaha thats what it is
by trying not to appear political they make it obvious that they are political time to expand the court
why the judicial system or even any branch of govt having any right to decide over your own health should never be the case
i never knew how that leak affected the conservative side but i knew that it benefited them many were screaming that the left wa behind it but from the beginning i could only see it firmly influencing the decision to overturn
abortion is overused a a form of birth control
more reason for democrat to unpack the extreme court that the federalist society spent 400m to pack
too many explosive bombshell this week
follow the money
we all have the right to deny medical treatment for ourselves morally no one ha the right to deny others of medical treatment
republican your teaching yoiu child to lie
supreme court justice can be impeached by congress we need to vote more democrat in so we can remove these who lied and who are being bought vacation house etc
the church bench that wa called scotus will ruin our democracy and trash our constitution
i blame the democrat for not putting woman bodily autonomy immediately into law honour system in day of trump a fairy tale the shame is democrates who failed woman in usa
seriously nothing but cuss word in my head yup the court is 1000 corrupt
ill never understand why they keep pursuing this poisoned pill gen z turned up in drove after the last time and helped turn what wa supposed to be a red wave into a red sprinkle and historically abortion have always been popular but if it end up costing republican vote a it already ha and hastens the death of that ghoulish party then so be it this will just force more people to vote which ha historically been bad for republican who havent pulled out a w on the people vote in 2 decade
the supreme court is corrupted to it core this is a dictatorship with no accountability to the law and the ability to change the law at will to suit their own belief system is the dictatorship ethos judge must be held to the higher court of a citizen review authority based on majority rule had that been in place over the year many of the attempt to deregulate corporation citizen united and yes abortion right would never have been accepted into our system of government in my opion yes opinion this started with the lewis powell appointment to congress in 1971 he is the infamous writer of what is most often called the lewis powell memo since then the court ha systematically sided with corporation over the wellbeing and right of the vast majority of american citizen hense here we are with even the middle class preceeding into homelessness and poverty due to a biased congress with the aid and comfort of the supreme court i think a civil oversight with authority to bring court decision to the process of a national vote before institution would align the court more closely with the constitution
buy and sell give me a break they were bought
even ginsberg thought the original ruling wa wrong
fortunately the recriminalization of abortion in canada through legislative andor judicial mean will not see the light of day evidently abortion ha long remained a proverbial thirdrail of canadian politics
none of this information is new this wa reported when roe wa overturned this video wa clickbait
a conspiracy occurred to stack the court with activist conservative federalistleonard leo lie under oath to congress etc we the people have been deprived of our civil right due to that conspiracy conspiracy to deprive right people have died due to this conspiracy woman denied abortion there are law against that with the most severe penalty allowed under the constitution the corrupt court is not immune a the conspiracy occurred prior to their term amendment i give u the right to opine
i wonder how many time leonard leo wa consulted
man i love when hayes ha smart folk on his show this reporter wa great
rbg should have stepped down when obama wa in office there wa way too much riding on an 87 year old woman
thank you jodi but man chris wa trying to push his narrative
if woman abortion right is denied supreme court would act exactly the same with the devil china communist party which control whether woman can have baby and how many if allowed
i mean it wa a double edge sword probably have a gop super majority in the house and senate if they hadnt
so whats happening with thomas and robert again with their corruption why havent we heard anymore update about their shady deal while in public service
this is soooo wrong
keep religion out of politics keep politics out of religion or make the church pay tax mike wont like that
no matter what case the fact that 5 unelected people can make the most momentous decision is a flaw one of many in our justice system
the left want depopulation abortion poisoned food poisoned water poisoned airwar war war killing our young people war is money
notwithstanding the evisceration of roe v wade by the reactionary justice on the supremely political court of the united state roughly eighteen month ago these militant antichoicers will stop at absoutely nothing until they finall succeed in enshrining the patently odious concept of fetal personhood throughout the american political landscape should this extraordinarily unfortunate situation ever become reality then the united state will definitely cease to the the land of the free and the home of the brave believe it or not the enshrinement of fetal personhood throughout the american political landscape by these militant antichoicers would actually entail an outright ban on assistive reproduction technology including invitro fertilization
i fear learning just which supreme court roster wa more corrupt and selfserving than this one tempting a it is to go by appearance we cant assume theyre the most corrupt and incompetent but perhaps it is critical to learn if not why this particular court is not the most corrupt and incompetent and shameless of supreme court
it seems amazing that trump instinctively put the supreme court on his side now the whole right is under his support very concerned a an oz very dangerous situation hard to change or stop them
i think alito leaked the draft or engineered the leak to lock it down
liberalism is a mental disorder abortion is not a constitutional right the justice are correct it a state issue the fed have no right telling the country how to live
enough babbling what are we the people going to do about it
people need to stop getting mad and vote voting result are why we have the current court we have voting is why roe wa overturned voting is why you have republican in state like texas who absolutely refuse to allow woman to have autonomy over their own pregnancy all of the thing you see happening are because of the way people voted if trump didnt win the presidency you wouldnt now have a 63 majority conservative court which in turn not only struck down 50 year of settled law but went against the majority of the will of citizen in the u you have woman in this country who keep voting for a republican party that historically over the past 50 plus year ha been overwhelmingly antiwoman in it policy and legislative voting record but woman keep voting against their own interest by voting republican if you want something different than do something different if you want different legislation than vote differently and put different people in office
she only voted no because of perception and timing otherwise she wa all in
the shady judge looking into a leak is laughable
the court is a crooked a the administration that loaded it
america ha defeated many enemy before and we have done so this time justice ha prevailed
it wa political
kangaroo court rendering the law without merit it only a matter of time when the law will be completely ignored and the people will refuse to acknowledge they have any import at all
the guy that retired is the obvious leader of this leak
the result of taking away people right is _losing bigly in elections_
there ha never been a consitutional right to anabortion roe v wade wa a lie
speaker johnson a woman duty is to birth at least one taxpayer it all about money and control period they dont have a problem pulling the plug on life support from a beating heart
who dud it
i think they knew who leaked but wont say so because it would be devastating to trump and the republican my guess it wa ginni thomas who leaked it to steve bannon who deliberately published it on mother day that is totally a bannon move he is radtrad catholic started the movement which hold that the current pope is not the true pope because he is too liberal a long time business partner of ginni thomas and thought mother day wa precisely when he should stick a dagger into all woman heart he despicable
more lie from the new york time
we have the most corrupt supreme court in the history of the u alito and thomas should resign in disgrace for their failure to uphold the rule of law and the constitution they run over with impunity
you people are such zealot on the murder of innocent childrenastonishing
they didnt want to appear political the whole thing is political from blackmail threat of changing their vote to already have made a decision before ever hearing the argument half the court also lied in their confirmation hearing no respect for any of these hack
name one theocratic government that work anyone
false title again nothing to do with the leak
no more skydaddy in our justice system
no selfrespecting woman should vote republican same go for men who care about their mother daughter sister niece wife girlfriend a well
democrat worried about palestinian child being killed but dont mind million of unborn baby being torn from the womb thing that make you go huh
uncle clarence ha got to go
and the extreme dt appointed judge that vote against choice are the one that dont want to fund welfare or food stamp maybe they should donate their million to the woman that have to raise their unwanted child
something about barrett i thijnk she might actually put her oath and the law before her personal opinion and belief and certainly before politics what i am saying here is i sense there is something in this woman that might be ethical after all we shall see
next they will ban birth control
i always suspected that it wa one of the conservative justice or their staff who leaked the draft they knew that would lock in the vote yet we had fox news losing their mind claiming that it had to be one of the liberal justice
the supremely corrupt opinionated terrible unscrupulous sinnners
but once the baby is born it ha no right to a good lifethese gentleman dont care what happens to the newborn or child that is the mother problem no public funding not even a dialogue because it not politically convenient to say that now the country will need to support these baby for the next x year birth control is also being taken off the table
overturning roe is the equivalent of a declaration of war on american woman we will not tolerate this the supreme court power is founded entirely upon the good will of the populace they can make whatever decision they want but we the people do not have to cooperate by making decision that are so diametrically opposed to the will of 80 of the people the court undermines it own power
isnt there a way to prosecute these supreme court justice or disbar them from office judge thomas and barret are clearly corrupt
msnbcdemocrat party propaganda machine
never forget who put them there the gop
it is about politics and power and certainly not about law and reason anymore so let be real about that
look likeit obviously is someone need to hold them accountable this antiabortion b is anticonstitutional
503 no that doesnt change a thing about how we think of her she still voted to take away life saving health care look at texas
using abortion a a mean of birth control is a obscene a it get and dont bother telling me that it doesnt happen
usually an abortion leak ha a foul odor
long a it a republican around it will be turmoil
my money is still on ginny thomas a the leaker
calling these people justice is offensive a group of unjust corrupt politician pretending to be judge
great scotus is stuffed with lying jerk
i still believe some on our highest court are being blackmailed for that escort service in manhattan that muller investigated the steele dossier said several member of the gop and some high sitting judge were customer of this escort service i believe some are being blackmailed tump said he knew he would only put in judge he knew would overturn roe he wasnt wrong because he knew the dirt held on them everyone be out here covering their a
5 4 a super majority jodi please
shes making decision based on what the other justice do how about making decision based on what the _law says_ since that is her job and all birth slavery _is_ slavery it not legal here
would politician please quit practicing medicine leave it to doctor and their patient
like oh wow surprise the two justice with the worst ethic who make the worst legal argument are apparently the source of the leak for bad faith reason shocker
wow surprise surprise not if ginsberg hadnt died i doubt that any of this would have happened or been passed she would have put her foot down and stopped it
the important part that everyone seems to skip is the fact that the justice mind were made up before they had even heard any evidence what is the point of having a trial if no evidence you bring before them ha any effect on the outcome it not a trial then it not justice they should throw out the ruling on those ground
impeach and replace or stack up the stained court
alito or thomas is the leak that much is now painfully obvious
well if the american public continue to believe in supreme court to solve the law should by nfts and if the public doesnt believe it headed towards gilead
if that is not politics i dont know what is supreme court must not play politics supreme court must not have life term 8 year is enough
bombshell new report on the supreme court abortion leak explicitly refuse to conjecture about who leaked the draft opinion i like chris hayes but this is clickbait
the supreme joke
religion is wrong people it racist it sexist it evil there is no place for religious buffoonery in modern society
you didnt have to give the leaker name the only justice that would have a motive to leak this and force a vote to go along with this whether he wanted to or not alito forced this into the spotlight to cement this and make it happen alito wa worried about kavanaughs vote the timing though thats too convenient the election wa le than 2 month away and a long a ruth wa still around they couldnt do it this whole thing smell there are no coincidence amy is in the wing and they needed her vote to make this work this whole thing wa orchestrated to appear coincidental and perfect timing
it is amazing to people outside of america the justice system there is not about the law it is about politics
youve been sentenced to one night of rehabilitation
this supreme court is actually a religious tribunal there no court to be found they create law to fit their christofascist belief and they twist fact to serve their religious agenda
the federalist society owns the supreme court x45 wa just the clown that drove the bus
alito leaked the decision imo
30000 baby were saved since abortion roewat
i dont understand why robert is so mad it almost like he thought the court had some sort of right to privacy and he should have been granted some sort of right to choose if or when to release a document concerning the difficult decision to terminate a right that had already been created and wa well established instead of some random person who somehow found out and made the decision for him im so sorry justice robert i have a great deal of sympathy for you this whole leak seems like a gross violation of trust i cant possibly imagine how you must feel
rbg would have retired and let obama replace her but knowing the chosen one could not be beaten by trump rbg decided to retire after distillary wa elected allowing the first woman president to replace her in an historic event sadly distillary lost and rbg bellied up while trump wa president and for that i will always thank her
it not interesting that these activist politically one sided people liers call themselves judge over the population on personal issue based upon someone religion overturning and retracting long established personal freedom that evey other wealthy democratic nation defends those are supreme ayatollah not supreme court judge based in constitutional government
forget abortion scotus is going to take away our country when they say chump cant be tried
this is a bombshell msnbc a politically stacked court go against presidency and remove human right but one wanted to wait 3 month they tok away right from woman in 2022 a bombshell would be that the right wing crook on the bench all decide to resign because of the damage that they did to the court
half of the supreme court is fascist america
nothing new here certainly not bombshell it just a leftist theory fake news again
barrett wa likely playing judicial politics in tgst she knew the 4 vote were enough
ginsberg wa the least corrupt
my vote is alito wa the leaker
corruption in current scotus can be ameliorated by setting an age limit of 70 year so sick of old men destroying the life of people who still have their own hair knee and teeth
the supreme court judge are just corrupt career politician with the title judge their ambition and greed ha destroyed any integrity and sense of justice they once may have had
ok whats the overunder on kavanaugh being the impatient pissant who leaked
their decision are leaked intentionally by them
sure the problem is who leaked the information not the corrupt justice that work for their oligarch
please get to the point of the title
the mind reel that a civilized democracy could even consider such medieval cruel misogynistic and barbaric behaviour a the banning of abortion i am 73 and my generation fought incredibly hard to have medically safe abortion become legal this reversal in the u is just mindblowing and so tragic for woman so very grateful that i am canadian
why do i get this weird impression that theyre suggesting amy coney barret leaked the draft
this is one thing about the dems that tick me off they a far a i can tell arent doing anything to prevent it they have had numerous opportunity and option to fix this still waiting
what this absolutely clarifies is that it wa someone on the antiamerican religious right who chose to leak specifically to subvert a slightly more reasonable compromise it hard for me to fathom why each and every justice isnt thoroughly investigated on a routine basis for clearly many are so thoroughly corrupt they have no business not being in prison without true transparency there is no justice anyone who belief otherwise is dangerously delusional
this isnt fascinating a kantor put it it just despicable partisanship and selfinterest those thing arent fascinating theyre lizardbrained theyre low
dollar to donut the leak came from a conservative justice staff thats why the investigation quietly went away without any information on who leaked it
818 bahh they want that freedom they need that freedom and when theyre gon na do something unthinkable they leak it
we investigated ourselves and we found we did nothing wrong
it wa a political stance that had no bearing on whether or not she would vote to strike down roe v wade it wa all about keeping up appearance they lied to get their position and theyll lie to keep the people satisfied to keep them there
abortion leak
every situation should be looked at individually not all cramned into one abortion bill or law
austin power it a man baby lol
im so glad that the justice were not on the court when i had my ectopic and lost the embryo from the uterus i would be dead and unable to care for my seven yo i had an emergency ultrasound and then emergency surgery that night i wa having pain so i wa able to take blood test on sunday for pregnancy but level low indicated ectopic likely pain start becoming more intense on monday ultrasound and emergency surgery this is how fast thing can evolve thank god that i wa an rn and know the rope i believe in choice and medical emergency do happen these decision are made between a doctor and his patient
omg have them finding out the truth about the supreme court that is not in the public interest and move along there is nothing to see here say the un biased justice who dont want thing they do in private and their richpecial friend to be known to the public
when your supreme court is bent a country not in trouble it in crisis
no one is above the law exception expotuss scotus judge the richyup no one
woman now have to turn to lawmaker to make decision about their healthcare i guess we should seek legal advice from doctor
soooootrump set the tone
they didnt care what case it wa they took they were just waiting to overturn roe and took whichever one came along
they couldnt wait till rbg died corruption run rampant in that court i never thought i would distrust the supreme court of the u im 75 year old i worry for my grand and great grang childern
with the 932 comment already posted i find it fascinating that almost none of them discus what hate and m kantor are talking aboutbecause it wa fascinating wa everything involving justice acb smoke and mirror what wa the motive of the individual who leaked the document wa there always going to be a 54 majority no one seems to be talking about these thing rather most of the comment are a woman should have a right to choose and vote biden 2024 if you want democracy and the supreme court is corrupt all thing that fall on the probablytodefinitely true spectrum but most of which miss a lot of the point made in the above video
rbg should have retired when obama wa in the wh and they had the senate
i cant understand how corrupt judge make these kinda decision
once again the word bombshell is overused in social medium jodi kantor gave u some interesting information from behind the scene but it wasnt a bombshell with the majority right wing justice this wa going to happen
perjury trial for scotus that lied during their confirmation hearing saying that roe wa established precedent liar under oath there are penalty for that
i dont understand why democrat let religious fanatic talk about abortion on their term it isnt about the right of fetus it is a religious christian evangelical fundamentalist view on woman designed to control their sexuality and essentially making them second class citizen if it wa about minimizing number of abortion mandatory vasectomy on all male of age would be a far le intrusive or dangerous way to go forced birth and the loss of bodily autonomy is basically criminalizing female sexuality
is this interview a joke
it not a consrervitive super majority it a privately owned by leonard leo a tool to bypass the democratic process this is direct attack on the u constitution
it wa ginni
pro choice is pro life life of the mother life of child after they are born
a the republican racist a a were prevented the first black president in american history from sitting a supreme court justice because what he wa black or half black then they let dog a trump have the supreme court they said when obama tried to fill the supreme court you cant it too close to an election and we have to let the people decide they feel ruth bader ginsburg seat while before her body wa even cold which wa a very stark difference from the year and a half obama had to wait to not be able to see the supreme court justice
supreme court judge should be on term limit periodt
the last 3 trump appointed justice all told congress that they felt that roe wa established case law they lied simple a that
deciding the law guided by political expediency exactly what supreme court justice are required to be above
m kantor is already a great journalist and i look forward to all her future endeavor oh yeah and alito leaked his own draft the po
policians shouldnt be making medical decision
they dont even look judicial look like they have an ulterior motive to men
can someone at least explain why the leak cemented vote like if im a supreme justice i control the rest of the story i write the endorsement why feign disapproval for 3 month this is the kinda crap which seems dismissal in coincidence when it first come out but becomes a national embarrassment in 20 year once theyve made life altering ruling without any consequence
make me think about the same person that suggested to our former president that it wa a good idea to appoint fake elector to overturn the decision they didnt like from the voter
news flash roe ha publicly said shes pro life
if scotus justice are allowed to lie under oath during their confirmation why would you expect better from regular folk and politician
we dont need supreme court at all all this 6 of them involved either the money and they have to make decision for all american people shut the door
the satanic left get furious when people try to stop their sacrificing
this should be the topic of an expose film and soon
samuel alito wa the leaker this twisted man hatred of woman is so intense that he leaked this document and people need to stop dancing around it and him he took a victory lap and spat in all of our face he tell u every day that he is untouchable and we cant stop him democrat need complete control of the senate to remove that man from the bench
trump need to be made ineligible for the presidency he a criminal
like trump the conservative justice are liar everyone of them is for sale
thank you chris i appreciate your clarity and evidence of the value that you uphold
filth that doesnt work for the american people absolutely disgusting
clearly overturning roe v wade also highlighted why america founding father never even considered allowing woman to vote
a great trip mick so good to see behind the helmet so to speak nice
we are two completely different country that are trying to be one we need to let these republican state exist on their own they wouldnt want that though because most of the government assistance money come from liberal state tired of these christian psycho forcing their delusion onto u
well complicated my two simple cent seems after the leak they saved face for the hard right not a way to adjudicate the law of the land
love this supreme court
the havoc the supreme court unleashed on woman is despicable and please stay out of woman healthcare
it should be prochoice and antichoice
blackmail
pro choice here but it is hard to see how the 14th amendment implied the right to abortion we wasted 50 year when we should have passed legislation permitting abortion but we couldnt even get the equal right amendment ratified and that wa a spicy a rice pudding
they should realize that if trump is re elected he wont need any of them
the scotus is a breach of trust the entire court is corupt
overturning roe wa one of the stupidest thing the right ha ever done not only did they galvanize left they handed the left a winning platform on a golden platter
they all lied about changing president they need to be removed for lying
the way you all journalist express yourselves with the wrong word fascinating position the barett and then hayes making a statement it faaascinating lalalaaa chris it is apalling
the great thing about banning abortion it nullifies qualified immunity you cant have female cop on the force with protection not afforded to them under the constitution or the supreme court how is a female cop going to face her accuser in the court of law when thats also her baby daddy
you do know jeffery epstein lawyer became a judge and wa the one who signed off on mar a largo search if not then your not paying attention
why dont they ever have arguenents about how to prevent conception why are all the arguements about what to do after the woman conceives
they lied in their conformation hearing commitimng perjury in the senate and should be removed
the supreme court now is only about politics and not about the constitution
this ha nothing to do with the constitution it is simply about fulfilling a minority political agenda
and people wonder why trump succeeded and why he going to succeed again this video tell all it a sham they seem to be against trump but are fully supporting him disgusting on all front
i always think alito himself may have leaked it
theyre appallingly evil
well the satanic church support abortion kinda tell you all you need to know about it
it is politics even when the court is right this court make it decision out of donor ownership loyalty
this isnt a country it a criminal enterprise
this wa over a year ago u think
it good that the supreme court banned abortion because now i can have ton of kid
how can this court be trusted bet the court will rule that 45 ha immunity
bombshell u told me nothing what a scam
elevating trump led to 3 more saltine supremacist on the supreme court
my takeaway from this is that decision regarding what constitutes ethical conduct are more realistic when made privately rather than publicly
the source of that leak ha been obvious ever since it happened
democrat appoint a woman to the court that doesnt know what a woman is and have the audacity to complain about decision made concerning woman their cognitive dissonance is on full display
geees you lazy people they sent it to the state which mean you cant have a say so in what the law say and doe do your friggin job and call your elected officals and hild them responsible they work for you not the other way around
this is exactly why scotus ha become a joke many conservative justice were bought by billionaire and sold their vote long ago is it any surprise that scotus ruling are being scorned and ignored these justice have lost our respect because they didnt have any respect for the position they hold or the bench they sit on we need scotus reform now 13 justice to match 13 federal court set term limit impeach thomas and alito finally vote blue
there were 3 breach of trust when 3 supreme court justice said under oath that roe v wade wa established precedent and no intention to overturn
take that liberal idiot
trump campaigned that he would pick judge that would overturn roe liberal stayed home in 2016 and gave them 3 judge the liberal government had complete control and didnt codify anything in 2020 22 because they believed lying judge when they said they wouldnt overturn the decision we then get the leak and people still didnt believe they would do it now here we are with abortion banned all across the u and liberal are once again thinking about doing a protest vote in 2024 against biden mark my word if people stay home and trump win they would find a way to make the ban a federal law
she need the cover for the scrotus investigation that should be conducted she voted with the fascist trumpalodyte party and the bought and paid for justice they groomed these case with the fascist federalist society
even the infamous rbg said roe v wade wa judicial gymnastics and wondered why it ha been challenged in court before then
please end abortion
stop minority religious cult from enslaving woman
ah so democrat hate supreme court the constitution who wouls have know
if the justice on the supreme court think that abortion is wrong then they should not get one period
omg the supreme court had a abortion
this court need to be investigated and corrupt justice need to go how do we action this
brings on a trans guy a an expert on how woman feel how about stop killing baby
it a simple a it getspeople like this just want to pretend they are god
vote people into the house and senate who will vote to have accountability for justice why am i held to a more unfair system of justice than our scotus
the republican justice on the supreme court lied to get on the court and lied when they did end of story
advice to chris stop laughing through important point youre trying to make it reminiscent of carlsons hysterical cackle
time for biden to pack the court and outnumber the criminal corrupt maggat theocrats
justice coney barrett is a culpable every supreme court justice who overturned a woman right health care i dont care how you want to rewrite history the end result is woman are secondclass citizen and the supreme court justice are at fault
both bought and stolen court not living by a thing they say we need term limit yesterday
seems to me that this is an ethical situation didnt scotus just adopt a new code of conduct guess we will have a front row seat a we watch the justice investigate themselves for unethical behavior because waiting for your coworker to die seems pretty unethical and even more unethical is the suggestion to operate on secret decision without the american people knowing thats not just unethical thats deplorable and scary
this is a poor excuse to test what to test what to experiment with human life ef supreme court
so which one of them is the rat thats what everybody want to know
biden also need to appoint a judge asap dont let the republican play the game they did last time saying we cant appoint a judge during an election year tired of their crap
it is about politics and power that is what scotus ha become
oh yes leaking their corruption is a breach of trust republican really do have no bottom that they wont drop to in order to show how vile they are
bombshell i thought brett may have had an abortion or something
alito did it make me a little sick that he wa chomping at the bit to take away woman right to control their own body
they are the worst ever
at a minimum all trump judge need to be expelled a soon a orange turd is convicted
wow of course the overturning of roe did help to get people out to vote and may have worked against the republican
justice lied to congress when they said roe v wade wa settled law
i like how we still pretend that we dont know which side leaked it robert still working on that eh
good people dont lie and do not try to control female i dont see the freedom gop claim they support
when wa the leak again cause thats how long late you are getting this news out there it wa clarence thomas wa the lake 90 the other 10 is one of the other conservative justice i knew like within a couple week that wa a conservative justice probably within one week that wa a conservative within four or five it thomas
the republican supreme court is ruled by large financial institution and wealthy donor instead of evaluating based on the will of the people
this lady jodi kantor talk with a natural delay a if the audiovideo is not calibrated correctly but it is off topic yes fascinating yes
the problem is the political appointment of judge and justice a better system would be promotion on merit within the department
deciding not to take the case based on how it will look is saying it doesnt have anything to do with law it present a we want to do this but dont want to look eager to do it that is a politicized court not lawful
dont like abortion dont have one dont push your pro life view on others unless you also support other cause with the same fervor those cause childcare healthcare prenatal health education prison reform police reform voting right food security environmental protection limit to corporate power and influence not sending troop to die for profit
christian natiolism wonin the making behind the scene for the past 2 decadesand everyone fell asleep
im with chris barrett voting no first go round wa personal coverage she hasnt given anyone anything to think about when it come to her alito thomas kavanaugh and barrett all lied during their interview regular people get fired for jive like that depending on the severity and their lie fall under sever
only white male will have right
this guy is a great liberal partisan
robert ha failed a the chief justice and need to be removed from his position by congress every federal group constitutionally overseen by congress is in a state of failure every one changing president every four year ha stopped working so maybe it time to change the way congress function
there is no more justice and freedom in america now all are controlled by corrupted people
maybe im not hearing this right from this nyt reporter _blah blah blah_ what difference doe it make
curse the court
i said when it wa released a conservative judge did this they knew that released in june the anger would be felt at the poll in nov but released in february the people will have some other noise to distract their attention and by nov the affect on the election were the pink trickle instead of a blue wave that may have occurred if it had been released under normal court calendar schedule
remember this when you vote in 2024 the orange con man nominated these bozo
they still could have changed their vote after the vote
poor little trumpies
could have thought of a better video title
it so sad that those justice had their privacy violated
who care
part of what we need to remember say the kantor thanking chris
dont say abortion leak could have chosen better phrasing
wouldnt it be nice to be completely untouchable and knowing you can be for the rest of your life corruption unmatched in any society
why doe no one acknowledge that ruth bader ginsberg wa highly critical of how roe v wade wa decided
why do the majority of the supreme court justice ignore the seperation of church and state in the constitution
robert is concerned with his reputation than the country and the legal tradition they are supposed to uphold
there is no trust in the justice of scotus
another trumpazee justice that isnt a trumpazee
i am very impressed by jodi kantor a an investigative journalistintelligent sophisticated and nuanced reporting on this story having said that i am convinced justice alito most likely instigated the leak
listen to you snowflake cry you want to about feeling a law let talk about 1618 the constitutionin it original format dred scott the savagery of the south after they lost the war and implemented jim crow cry me a river i know the real reason they want to ban abortion dr france cress welsing
i dont feel any different about amy coney barrett because she just didnt want it to look a bad on her because she knew just like the other 2 trump nominated that regardless of the lie they told in their hearing they were always going to overturn roe she just didnt want it to be so soon because she is a chicken
i pray that they are seeing what they caused
let look at this pragmatically what wa the real effect of barrets deny nothing it all theater
so the chief orange justice worry about the leak not the consequence of his decision on the life of american these orange activist judge need to be impeached asap
lol freedom of faith or religion and freedom from religion or anothers faith no law shall be made that violates one own faith of belief or religion to be anothers same faith of belief or religion that go against the others own faith of belief or religion
there nothing supreme about any of them
so much for the legitimacy of the supreme court biden need to pack the court too much power in too few hand hand we can not trust that cling to power for far too long
theyll be coming after everyones right best wake up and smell the coco the goverment and the court have no business in people medical care and they certainly have no business in people bedroom they have no business saying who people can and cant love enough is enough with these clown
scotus is ruled by a group of individual that lied to get their position are blatantly political and the most corrupt group of justice in the history of america it is time for the lifetime appointment to be removed and that several of the current scotus justice be charged for their own illegal practice
supreme court doesnt care about people they just care about who is president that is why it wa overturned in the first place not to mention we have very large corruption of the supreme court judge
i knew it
this country is totally effed up my body my choice
remember republican majority put roe v wade into place to begin with if they try to tell you it some evil leftist thing theyre fighting this fact alone make it obvious it ha nothing to do with saving baby if that were the case theyd be talking about how to curb gun violence in the house instead of going on about public urination the left war on gas stove hunter bidens laptop etc
i never thought they waited the minute ginsburg died i knew we were doomed
unfortunately there are only a couple of justice that will simply apply the law then you have the balance interested in using their power for money and favorthis court need to be dismantled with interim until such time this can be rectified period
most constitutional juris prudence expert say that the scotus to include all court grant a hold while the legal aspect are being sorted out the conservative justice took 10 minute to decree an opinion
i have no trust nor respect for the supreme court taking money and expense gift from millionaire and billionaire is wrong the court is tainted
this court is a joke they are in it for themselves
the overturning of roe show a failing of the senate in the confirmation of the newest justice all three were asked if they would overturn roe v wade and all three evaded the question and replied that it wa settled law and instead of pressing for an actual answer the senate allowed that answer to stand all three of the newest justice should have been pushed until they replied with a real answer the senate dropped the ball
he did it alito spilled the information
abortion on demand no question asked
this is further proof that the roman catholic scotus is not independent and is not to be trusted
alito wa the leaker a criminal in robe
so what are we supposed to do if the highest court in the land is morally corrupt
coneybarrett belongs to an extremist charismatic christian group people of praise pop is verifiably and creepily out of step with sane american value survivor story illustrate the horror any sane adult would feel at the usurpation of selfdetermination buck the patriarchy
the lying nine
the u supreme court is illegitimate
nothing will happen to these traitor justice
the leaker didnt commit any crime
so there is no bombshell it just what we already knew it wa likely leaked by a conservative judge like alito to force the others into line the new judge were only concerned that it looked bad for them personally because like only 5 minute ago they were swearing under oath they considered roe settled law who would have thought that a political organisation grooming and promoting judge for appointment to the court could make the court look political when the organisation that put them there openly state the the reason they are being promoted america is a backsliding democracy and it didnt have a great one to begin with
sc justice are there to decide issue of law not to plot to make law that is usurping congress not to mention an abuse of power
it can look like politics and power yes because that is exactly what it is about
trump supreme court are they bright people who are just oblivious to the pandora box theyve opened or are they just not very brightperiod trump supreme courtwhat a winner arent we blessed
we need to win house and senate and oval office so we can add to the court
sorry to interrupt i would like to ask question why are we not talking about how the third party candidate are hurting the biden administration for reelection and the reason trump will be again a president dictator is because of third party candidate that are taking away the vote and have no chance zero chance of winning they should own up bow out after supporter to vote for biden otherwise well we know the outcome and that is trumpet victor
liar liar liar kavanagh is american destruction
when king trump appeal everything up to the supreme corrupt court he will get away with everything if there no precedent then anything can be changed
who and how much were they paid to bring death and poverty to american woman
to even have the thought that the supreme court majority are total scum and mostly corrupt is saddening
trump lead biden by 17 point thank you demoncrats for making america great again
just want to point out that these ghoul literally started looking for a conservative replacement for rbg before her body wa even cold and by literally i mean literally
sheldon whitehouse ha been sounding the alt on the supreme court that billionaire bought
the conservative majority is corrupt bought and paid for by leonard leo and the far right billionaire whose dark money fund the gop
my money say kavanagh or thomas leaked
yeah but here the real kicker they both thought trump wa gon na still be in office
weighing the pro and con of when to hear roe is the pinnacle of acting political these religious zealot are dangerous and a total threat to democracy and the constitution
7 of 9 are catholic the justice system in this country is getting highjacked by jesus
jodis not gon na burn her source but the report make it pretty obvious that the leak wa from the forced birth contingent to shut down internal debate which i believed from the beginning no wonder robert ha shut his piehole about it after yammering on about an investigation lol
all but 2 of these loser should be cleaning toilet in jail cell
justice ginsburg let her own accolade and ego get in the way and wound up defeating the very cause she dedicated her life to i hate it too but it the truth
a a u army veteran and christian i could never understand how conservitives and christian think they have the right to shove thier belief down the throat of others who have different belief it not christlike behavior it pretty simple if your against abortion then dont get or have one no one is forcing anyone to get an abortion but stripping that right to away from others who have different belief is wrong we are a nation of many different people with many different type of belief and no one form of belief is superior to anyone elsesjust different it seems the conservitives and fundamental christian seem to have more in common with the talibanbelieve my way or else freedomchoice
term limit please
the meaning is nothing her vote to not take the case on wa purely because she had just testified that roe wa settled law and her voting to not take up the case mean nothing at all when she then went and voted to overturn roe just typical two faced lying from right winger
three daughter vote blue
ginny thomas wa the leaker
it wa a shocking decision for the conservative sc justice to overturn r v w but no one should have been shocked we knew that the list of recommended sc justice nominee submitted to trump when he wa president wa a list compiled by the federalist society the federalist society wa only going to include on the list nominee that had already pledged to overturn r v w you didnt pas muster and make the list if there wa any doubt about how you would rule regarding r v w it didnt take much to imagine that trump in his one on one with nominee demanded they pledge to him that they would overturn r v wit wa a personal promise they had to make to become one of the trump nominee there should never have been any doubt that r v w wa going to be overturnedthat wa the deal
the one who promised to never try and overturn roe v wade during their hearing and then did so should be charged with purgery
click bait
i know shes a hero but rbg didnt do the country any favor by not retiring when her health wa getting bad so obama could have appointed her successor now thanks to her decision were stuck with a corrupt rightwing extremist court that frequently serf political power grabbing by the gop not whats honest and best for the american people under the constitution
republican will never win another presidential election thanks to the overturning of roe v wade
precedent is just thrown out the window nothing existed before the revolution
so much for precedent and the word of the supreme court justice
the court made the correct ruling we should all celebrating the wonderful caring ruling that show we a a country are not selfish but that we value life
so republican claimed it wa the libs that leaked it to help their casebut it wa the conservative that knew it would end persuasion or compromise
i remember thinking in high school that the u supreme court justice must be such great human being to have made it to position so incredibly important i thought so highly of them sad how wrong i wa
im grateful someone spoke up these judge think they can do what they want without consequence or accountability this is the problem in america today
the united state supreme kangaroo court
i am done with the men on the court they hate me and want to control me done how do we remove them now
no trust in this court at all no ethic and full political term limit with stronger standard or code than the lower court to start immediately
even the judge at the hague only get 9 year term these clown get lifetime gig
breach of trust describes the supreme court against the american people
i dont believe those conservative justice thought twice about over turning roe they dont care vote blue 2024
if it wa a right it could not be taken away roe v wade wa a mere privilege and wa taken away woman have le right than a corpse
they want to go back to medieval time suffering is not the only option we have modern medical science now
she look like tim roth this all go back to billionaire money running everything
after alito make his reasoning i hold no faith in his judgement
time to impeach these judge or change law from lifetime appointment to time limit
the corruption court
most of them cant fathom what it is for a woman to have one so why should they even have a say
they want to overthrow row v wade but dont want the bad rep of being the one doing it and failing at it pretty sure theyd be the most hated judge if that happened both by their own supporter and their opposition
im sorry but i cant help feeling angry at ginsburg this partly due to her selfishness
awesome we love your bombshell report dnbc and msnbc we keep waiting for bombshell follow up report but never see them would this be called spinning perhaps or just plain propaganda
the bible is neither antiabortion nor prolife but doe provide a biblical basis for the real motivation behind the antiabortion religious crusade hatred of woman the bible is antiwoman blaming woman for sin demanding subservience mandating a slavemaster relationship to men and demonstrating contempt and lack of compassion i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth child and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee gen 316 what selfrespecting woman today would submit willingly to such tyranny the antiabortion position doe not demonstrate love for humanity or compassion for real human being world health organization estimate maternal death at 500000 a year with at least one in five stemming from unsafe illegal abortion thousand more are hurt and maimed from illegal or selfinduced abortion unwanted pregnancy and complication from multiple pregnancy are a leading killer of woman why do antiabortionists want north american woman to join these ghastly mortality statistic every day around the world more than 40000 people mostly child die from starvation or malnutrition we must protect and cherish the right to life of the alreadyborn
how much more b doe american needbiden need to expand sc and stop the destruction of democracy
stare decisis is dead because of this decision a court with right wing liar touting established stare decisis before congress then obliterating it first chance they got liar of the supreme court
selfrighteous red robed rethuglican justice with religious indoctrination rob woman of their inherent right because theyre misogynist if men could get pregnant decision about their body would be private and unquestioned selfgovernance the right of a woman or girl to make autonomous decision about her own body and reproductive function is at the core of her basic right to equality privacy and bodily integrity written by misogynist promoted by christian religious cultist 1 timothy 212 i do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man rather she is to remain quiet corinthian 143435 let your woman keep silence in the church for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience a also saith the law and if they will learn any thing let them ask their husband at home for it is a shame for woman to speak in the church deuteronomy 211114 and seest among the captive a beautiful woman and hast a desire unto her that thou wouldest have her to thy wife then thou shalt bring her home to thine house and she shall shave her head and pare her nail and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her and shall remain in thine house and bewail her father and her mother a full month and after that thou shalt go in unto her and be her husband and she shall be thy wife and it shall be if thou have no delight in her then thou shalt let her go whither she will vote blue for democracy and freedom liberty and justice for all not just some

lord help u especially all the lady the justice of the high court are corrupt
completely corrupt court bought and paid for
when will it be called corruption until the medium us the proper english the way we the normal people do the effect of the maga are being normalized
how can the same country go to the moon and create a corrupt supreme court
i wonder how much it cost to get roe v wade turned back the best justice money can buy
the sc is wrong in that voter know anyway medium a suck
trusttrusttrustfrom this supreme courtr u kidding wth
jodi didnt come here to play game
not sure thats the breach of trust to be concerned about here
they got paid to over turn roe v wade
who care about a leak about something you were about to immediately do anyway
justice kavanaugh should be nowhere near the law because he ha no idea what an entail or how to interpret it clarence thomas is completely corrupt and alito life in the 19th century
rbg is with gf now
maybe they should ban viagra if pregnancy is god will so is limp
every child thats ever been aborted could have been the next albert einstein cured cancer or just the common cold or even developed a warp drive that would give u the ability to reach other star and solar system in a matter of day instead of million of year imo the left is literally destroying our future from within the womb
youtube ha censored again and again and again
be interesting see these corrupt judge experience some post birth abortion to themselves
youtube ha censored again and again and againthe following youtube ha censored again and again and againthe following youtube ha censored again and again and againthe following cult continuous cowardice cult of continuous criminality cult of continuous corruption cult of continuous sedition cult of continuous treason cult of continuous terrorism cult of continuous antiamericanism
the process of appointing judge need solid rule that cant be impacted the way mitch mcconnell did he stopped obamas nominee from june and held it until trump wa in office the following january then forced trump final nominee through congress in september of 2020 before trump wa ousted thats the first crime against american then even though they all declared the roe v wade setteled law they went back on their constitutional requirement and readjudicated it according to their religious belief now who can i take breach of trust to for a hearing if the 1 court in the land can toss out the separation of church and state weve lost the core of america founding your religion is yours to practice a long a it doesnt encroach on my religious freedom they are placing one religion above all others which is why we succeeded from great britain in the first place
the meaning is she didnt want to appear like she wa anti abortion and she lied in her confirmation hearing
all the justice that voted to strike roe down lied in their confirmation hearing
maga is to the republican what nazism wa to the german absolutely no difference whatsoever
youtube ha censored again and again and againthe following cult continuous cowardice cult of continuous criminality cult of continuous corruption cult of continuous sedition cult of continuous treason cult of continuous terrorism cult of continuous antiamericanism
bottom line it political and disgusting
the supreme court is about politics and not justice
mccarthy cult goldwater cult nixon cult ford cult reagan cult it a cult it ha always been a cult just slightly different packaging
amy barrett is a lowlife fake she and that other drunk that got appointed it time to change those lifetime appointment they should have to run every 4 year like the rest of the politician and there need to be term limit on all politician the choice to have a bunch of kid is hers not everyone else she is a fake christian too she doesnt have the right to bring her personal view into politics
a breach of trust to the woman of america shame on them do these unqualified justice now see what happens when they let the state take care of it woman are usable to get the care they need because wrinkled assed old white men know more than the doctor shame on the last three for lying america now in some state are worse than third world country i dont care if amy had 17 child she wa part of destroying healthcare for woman who have no power shame on them
next up take away woman right to vote courtesy of this supreme court
more political b by desperate joe bidens lover
so what im hearing is that 9 adult have their internal meeting note exposed to the public and they all decide that mean they have to immediately freeze their decisionmaking ability that they just cant continue a though that leak never happened that they cant say yeah well thats a draft and it not a done deal and there no guarantee that were going to do that it a work in progress what kind of spineless idiot are on that court
every time this happens every time
that court is corrupt
just imagine america what our supreme court will become if another republican get elected president in the next two or three presidential election they will be ruling against the will of most american for the next two generation at least vote blue across the board this is not time for those who love american democracy to lose focus
why is it surprising that kavanaugh is a weasel
scotus gronk shag mlor breer bos clon and the other caveman in the group are certainly america back hundred of year
these people arent prolife theyre probirth once a child is born they dont care what happens to it
we knew most of this already we knew that alito himself leaked the decision to cement and consolidate it
i am absolutely dry heaving sickened
the whole supreme court is a breach of trust
fixed term that have to be renewed
everyone know it wa alito he is pretty stupid to think we dont know it wa him because he did it before
when it come to standing legal precedent which roe ha stood for 50 year completely unchallenged and the fact that a number of yet to be appointed justice cited roe a being firmly established make a mockery of them
this scotus is morally corrupt illegitimate
see it supreme kurt did that turnover roe v wade before the public it a leak from supreme court and the wealthy paid them also
i dont think a thinking feeling fetus should be aborted a woman doesnt need 15 week to decide she want an abortion 15 week is a compromise not a banning of abortion
american preach about freedom and yet it being stripped away but hey brother we got gun freedom woo
impeach the court then eliminate the republican traitor
i love the message we are all supposed to take away is leaking info bad and most of the comment are talking about how corrupt these justice are the people have spoken and the government doesnt care
they will all go down in history a the most corrupt bench of our life time
strongly support the speculation that alito leaked it to freeze in the win not only unethical with regard to taking favor apparently the rot is much deeper
term limit expand the court now the only answer at this point the supreme court ha lost all integrity now corrupted beyond belief thomas need removed without question
how do we the people change this there need to be term limit
it would be interesting if barrett ha a pregnancy where she need to get an abortion
it not like people have any confidence in the supreme court
meanwhile thomas is bought and paid for by harley crow and other rich white men
these folk on scotus all said they considered roe settled law in order to get seatedconfirmed by senate this is not just about politics and power but about one side who belief the rule of law only applies to the weak or naive i am disgusted kavanaugh barrett thomas etc should be impeached and removed merrick garland deserved seated instead of gorsuch
ill never understand america they protect your right to carry gun but not autonomy over your own body you can take away a life to protect your own if it with a gun but not a medical procedure law and religion are supposed to be separate
when are republican and scotus going to repeal a woman right to vote
how many leak is this leak
finally all thing are coming to light hopefully we all will be more prepared to fight fascism everything end in the same point fascism love for power narcisism evil it going it always come back unless we do not allow to happen again
we knew all along that alito leaked the draft to cement the vote for his handmaid fantasy world
but why who is the real winner
trump republican fascist party including trump republican scotus agenda is control oppression and power antidemocracy antifreedom of choice
this is one of many reason why i dont and wont trust the supreme court of injustice
the decision whether or not to have an abortion should be left between a woman and her medical professional and everyone else need to mind their own gd business an embryo potential right to life should never outweigh the mother very real right to life
delay delay delay sound like the court us the tactic similar to 45 for political persuasion
chief robert is like the policeman who blame you for possessing valuable when reporting a robbery
click bait bombshell nothing here distraction from bidens failing presidentcyvote republican no matter what or who
it wa never a case to judge it wa a done deal political stance waiting for a case a an excuse
so embarrassing our country is run by people that believe in an invisible man in the sky or at least pretend to
alito bragged to his fan so they leaked it i think we already know this these justice need to keep their trap shut if they dont want leak how dare robert
sure thing we will never know alito did it
biden wa extremely naive not to expand the supreme court especially if it end up costing american their life a it might easily do
this talibangelical scotus are all so frikin corrupt and were stuck with them for 40 more year unless by some miracle dems have control of the senate and presidency when alito and clarence kick the bucket
if the change look like bribery politics and power watch the pelican brief we need at lease three of those now
the leaker name rhyme with tinny ghomas
kudos to the level minded nyt journalist who is not trying to push an agenda chris hayes is just pushing that terroristic dem agenda
the supremely corrupt court
future justice of the supreme court should be elected by a straight national vote like the president taking politician out of the selection process is vital if the supreme court is to regain credibility
theyre going against the majority of citizen get out of our body corrupt court
so the only thing this reporting really reveals is that justice kavanaugh and barrett wanted to hide scotuss decided plan about overturning roe v wade from the public for a period of time in order to make the court action which wa blatantly political and about power look le like it political and about power did i miss anything
i dont think it that much of a mystery amy cohen barrett changed her yes to a no on taking the case on simply because the end result would be the same it only take 4 justice to take a case she wouldve been the 5th and she thought why dirty my hand on this decision when at the end of the day i can say im distancing myself from it and still get the result i want which is to overturn roe
biden job approval 33 pew research nov 27 dec 3
